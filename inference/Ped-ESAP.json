He is given a glucose and fluid bolus and is maintained on an intravenous dextrose and saline solution. He was born at term and was treated for neonatal jaundice.

         "answer": "B. Familial glucocorticoid deficiency",
         "explanation": "Familial glucocorticoid deficiency (Answer B) is the most likely diagnosis in view of this patient’s extremely high plasma ACTH levels. He lacks biochemistry suggestive of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (Answer D), and mineralocorticoid deficiency and adrenal antibodies that would point towards congenital adrenal hypoplasia (Answer C) or Addison disease (Answer A), respectively. Very long-chain fatty acid levels were normal, thus excluding X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (Answer E). This child was found to have a homozygous pathogenic variant in the gene encoding the ACTH receptor (MC2R; S74I [serine to isoleucine at amino acid position 74]), also known as the melanocortin 2 receptor. Many patients with this pathogenic variant are of Scottish descent. Familial glucocorticoid deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that typically manifests during early childhood or the neonatal period with symptoms of hypocortisolemia, the absence of mineralocorticoid deficiency, and very high plasma ACTH, which leads to intense hyperpigmentation. Tall stature, which normalizes after glucocorticoid replacement, is also a feature of MC2R pathogenic variants, probably through the action of ACTH on other melanocortin receptors expressed in bone. The diagnosis in this case is relatively late and demonstrates the phenotypic variability of this condition, even in those with the same pathogenic variant. Seven other genes associated with familial glucocorticoid deficiency have been identified to date, including MRAP (melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein), STAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein), MCM4 (minichromosome maintenance complex component 4), NNT (nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase), TXNRD2 (thioredoxin reductase 2), CYP11A1 (cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily A member 1), and SGPL1 (sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase 1). These genes are involved in diverse pathways, and the resulting phenotypes are caused by defective ACTH signaling, cholesterol transport, steroidogenesis, cellular redox homeostasis, DNA replication, or sphingolipid metabolism. There is increasing awareness of the variable phenotypes and associated conditions seen within the familial glucocorticoid deficiency umbrella of conditions. For example, evidence of mineralocorticoid deficiency (transient or permanent) has been described in those with severe pathogenic variants in MC2R and MRAP, as well as in patients with pathogenic variants in NNT. Later onset of symptoms has been observed in some persons with pathogenic variants in NNT and missense mutations in MRAP and CYP11A1. Furthermore, MCM4 and SGPL1 are associated with other disorders such as natural killer cell deficiency and progressive renal dysfunction, respectively. The other causes of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease [Answer A], congenital adrenal hypoplasia [Answer C], congenital adrenal hyperplasia [Answer D], and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy [Answer E]) should certainly be considered in the differential diagnosis. Overall, autoimmune causes (Addison disease and polyglandular syndromes) account for 80% to 90% of primary adrenal insufficiency, and most individuals are adrenal antibody positive. Autoimmune destruction is usually associated with mineralocorticoid deficiency; hence, in the absence of both features, an autoimmune cause is unlikely. Because this is a male patient, NR0B1 (formerly DAX1) pathogenic variants as a cause of congenital adrenal hypoplasia are also a possibility, but the late onset plus the lack of mineralocorticoid deficiency make this a less likely diagnosis. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy should always be considered and excluded by measuring very long-chain fatty acid levels. Late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia is another consideration, especially in view of the unexplained tall stature. However, in this case, normal androgens and prepubertal findings on examination do not support this diagnosis.",

       "answer": "A. X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets",
       "explanation": "While many features of these skeletal conditions overlap, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (Answer A) (XLH) is frequently associated with progressive bowing of the lower extremities that appears when young children learn to stand and walk, a waddling gait, short stature, and craniosynostosis (particularly with premature fusion of the sagittal sutures, resulting in the elongation of the skull or dolichocephalic malformation). While the exact incidence is unknown, a recent retrospective study suggests that craniosynostosis may occur in more than 50% of affected patients. Dental abscesses may develop as children get older. Craniosynostosis can result in increased intracranial hypertension and Chiari malformation type 1 with herniation of the cerebellar tonsils. In some cases, craniosynostosis does not occur until later in skull development, resulting in little morphologic changes and sufficient room for brain growth. However, craniosynostosis can be the presenting feature of XLH and can occur in children as young as 3 months. When cranial sutures fuse at a young age, surgical intervention may be required to prevent complications. Craniosynostosis syndromes can be due to pathogenic variants in the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors. FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) and FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) are involved in intramembranous osteogenesis, whereas FGF receptor 3 (FGFR3) has a primary role as an inhibitor of endochondral ossification. The primary receptor for FGF- 23 is FGFR1, and thus this may explain the association of craniosynostosis with this disorder. Pathogenic variants in FGFR3 are associated with hypochondroplasia (Answer C). Patients with this condition also have short stature, macrocephaly, and bowed legs, but frequently have short, broad hands and feet. However, these individuals rarely present with craniosynostosis or radiographic signs of rickets, so hypochondroplasia is an unlikely diagnosis in this case. One-third to two-thirds of patients with infantile hypophosphatasia (Answer B) also have craniosynostosis, frequently by 6 months of age. Affected children generally have other manifestations such as bellshaped chest deformity, respiratory compromise, seizures, and characteristic x-ray findings of metaphyseal tongues. While severe vitamin D deficiency (Answer D) could explain the radiographic findings in this patient, craniotabes is a rare skull manifestation of this condition, not craniosynostosis. There have been case reports of vitamin D excess causing craniosynostosis. Apert syndrome (Answer E) is due to pathogenic variants in the FGFR2 gene and is associated with short stature and bicoronal synostosis with resultant widely spaced eyes, exophthalmos, and midface hypoplasia. Affected patients also have characteristic changes of the hands including syndactyly, most commonly of the second through fourth fingers with a single common nail.",

She plans to eat dry cereal for her afternoon snack when she comes home from school.

She carefully measures 2 servings of one-third cup (total two-thirds cup) in a bowl. Her continuous glucose monitor reads 92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L) with a flat arrow. Her insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio in the afternoon is 1:6 (1 unit for every 6 g carbohydrate).",

        "answer": "C. 8 units",
        "explanation": "Calculating the needs for mixed-meal insulin in children with type 1 diabetes is challenging. Both the type and the amount of carbohydrate found in foods influence postprandial glucose levels and can also affect overall glycemic control in individuals with diabetes. Added sugars such as sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup are digested, absorbed, and fully metabolized in a similar fashion to naturally occurring monosaccharides and disaccharides. Only about half of the carbohydrate grams from sugar alcohols and half or less from dietary fiber are metabolized to glucose, whereas almost all “other carbohydrate” (mainly starch such as amylose and amylopectin) becomes blood glucose. All food labels indicate the amount of dietary fiber in the serving size, and newer labels provide further details about soluble and insoluble amounts. If the total fiber amount is greater than 5 g, half of the total amount, which usually corresponds to the insoluble portion, should be subtracted from the total carbohydrate amount to calculate the insulin dose. If insoluble fiber amount is listed, then it can be used to calculate directly. In this vignette, the patient plans to consume 54 g (27 g Å~ 2 servings) of total carbohydrates. The insoluble fiber amount is 3 g per serving, totaling 6 g. The amount of carbohydrate that needs to be considered for an insulin bolus is 54 minus 6, which equals 48 g. The correct insulin dose should be calculated by dividing 48 g by 6, which equals 8 units (Answer C). Ignoring the fiber content and calculating the insulin amount on the basis of the total carbohydrate of 54 g divided by 6, which equals 9 units (Answer B), would be incorrect. Subtracting all of the fiber content from the total carbohydrate amount (54 minus 10, which equals 44 divided by 6, which equals 7.3 rounded to 7 units [Answer D]) is also incorrect. Ten units (Answer A) provide extra insulin beyond the carbohydrate calculation. This may be valid in some practices that account for the fat and the protein content of the consumed food when determining the insulin calculation. There are data to suggest that 25% to 50% extra insulin may be needed to cover the fat and protein load of meals and snacks, delivered in an extended fashion that can be achieved by insulin pumps. However, in this vignette, there is no additional information to prompt one to consider extra insulin. Eating her snack and monitoring her glucose to decide on the amount of insulin (Answer E) is also wrong and goes against the concept that all “meal” insulin should be received before food consumption. This idea may be valid in special circumstances such as pending severe hypoglycemia if the patient’s continuous glucose monitoring indicated such scenario.",

        "answer": "C. Measure prolactin again in 2 to 4 weeks",
        "explanation": "Breast tissue is commonly found in term infants, and some milk secretion is common as well. Transient neonatal gynecomastia is thought to be caused by placental conversion of weak androgens to estrogens, which enter the fetal circulation and stimulate glandular proliferation in the breast. The patient in this case was referred because of the unusually large amount of breast tissue. There are few reports of hyperprolactinemia in children younger than 5 years and most are associated with other signs of pituitary/hypothalamic dysfunction. Defining the normal range for prolactin levels in the newborn is challenging; laboratory reference ranges do not identify separate ranges for infants and indicate a normal  range of less than 10 ng/mL (<0.4 nmol/L) for prepubertal males. One study of prolactin levels in infants and children suggests that the normal range for prolactin levels in 1-week-old neonates may be as high as 496 ng/mL (21.6 nmol/L), but drops to 63 ng/mL (2.7 nmol/L) in infants 2 to 12 months of age. Data on the 1-week to 2-month age range are lacking. While it is difficult to determine whether the infant in this case has an elevated prolactin level for his age, his value of 108.5 ng/mL (4.7 nmol/L) should prompt another measurement (Answer C) to ensure that it is decreasing. While pathology in such a young patient would be rare, there have been some reports of persistently elevated prolactin levels in infants. This infant’s prolactin level will most likely decrease over time, and therefore performing MRI of the brain and the pituitary gland (Answer A) would be premature. Imaging would be indicated if the prolactin level does not decrease over time, as there would be a greater chance of finding a hypothalamic pituitary defect. Given that this infant most likely has an exaggerated form of nonpathologic neonatal breast hypertrophy, dopamine agonist therapy (Answer D) to decrease the prolactin level is not indicated. This treatment would only be considered if the prolactin level does not decrease, and only after CNS imaging and further evaluation of hypothalamic/pituitary function. LH, FSH, and testosterone levels are most likely to be detectable due to the mini puberty of infancy and their measurement (Answer B) would not contribute to determining whether there is an underlying pathologic cause for this patient’s breast hypertrophy.Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 is associated with tumors of the pituitary gland. Individuals known or suspected to have multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 are advised to have MRI of the brain and measurement of prolactin, IGF-1, fasting glucose, insulin, and proinsulin every 1 to 3 years starting as early as age 5 years. While prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas are common in this syndrome, such manifestations would not be expected in an infant. Therefore, genetic testing (Answer E) is not warranted.",

        "answer": "A. Glycogen debrancher deficiency",
        "explanation": "This patient’s presentation is consistent with glycogen storage disease (GSD). Hepatosplenomegaly, elevated triglycerides, and hypoglycemia are the hallmark findings of GSD that presents in infancy. GSD types I through IV are the most common forms that present in infancy and are associated with hepatosplenomegaly. However, GSD type I (known as von Gierke disease) and GSD type III (known as Cori disease, Forbes disease, and limit dextrinosis) are the 2 forms associated with ketotic hypoglycemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and hyperlipidemia as observed in this patient. Because of this patient’s normal lactic acid level, the most likely diagnosis is GSD type III, or glycogen debrancher deficiency (Answer A). Lactic acid excess in GSD type I is due to buildup of glucose-6-phosphate, a condition not generally present in GSD type III. GSD type I, or glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (Answer C), is classically associated with ketotic hypoglycemia as a result of suppressed insulin secretion and increased secretion of counterregulatory hormones in response to hypoglycemia. Elevated glucose-6-phosphate is unable to be converted to glucose; therefore, it is converted to pyruvate. Excess pyruvate gets converted to lactate, especially in the presence of acidosis. These hormonal changes cause increased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, with lactic acidosis representing increased formation and decreased use of lactate. The hormonal changes also promote exaggerated lipolysis. This leads to an influx of free fatty acids to the liver, where a substantial fraction is converted to triglycerides, and increasing secretion of VLDL. In GSD type III, complete glycogenolysis is prevented by the lack of the glycogen debrancher enzyme, or amyloglucosidase, whose gene is located on chromosome 1p21. There are 4 subtypes of GSD type III as determined by variability in tissue expression of the debrancher enzyme: - GSD IIIa represents about 85% of all GSD type III cases (liver and muscle involvement) - GSD IIIb represents about 15% of all GSD type III cases (only liver involvement) -  GSD IIIc is very rare and is considered to be caused by a defect in glucosidase debranching activity - GSD IIId is also very uncommon and is thought to be caused by a defect in transferase debranching activity. During glycogenolysis and prior to the presentation to the debrancher enzyme, phosphorylase breaks down glycogen to 2 to 4 linked glucose molecules or limit dextrins. Then, the debrancher enzyme works through 2 processes: cleavage of a dextrin branch from the remaining glycogen molecule (amylo-1,6-glucosidase activity), as well as through the transfer of the dextrin to the free end of a dextran polymer (oligo-1,4-1,4-glucanotransferase activity) to release free glucose molecules. The defects associated with this disorder, and thus their clinical manifestation in patients, are variable. GSD type III, in contrast to GSD type I, can be associated with weakness, wasting of skeletal muscle, hypotonia, and cardiac defects. Cardiomyopathy can be found with or without left ventricular hypertrophy, and often presents in childhood. The skeletal findings and weakness are often manifested in adulthood. Osteopenia and osteoporosis commonly occur and appear to be due to lack of good metabolic control. Hepatomegaly and elevated transaminase levels generally improve as patients become older and often normalize after puberty. Adenomas are rarely found, but they have been reported to progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. GSD type VII (phosphofructokinase deficiency) (Answer B), GSD type VI (liver phosphorylase deficiency) (Answer D), and glucose transporter 2 deficiency (Answer E) do not present with the above findings.",

Loss-of-function pathogenic variant in the PAPPA2 gene (pappalysin 2).",
        "answer": "E. Loss-of-function pathogenic variant in the PAPPA2 gene (pappalysin 2)",
        "explanation": "Recently described pathogenic variants in the PAPPA2 gene (pappalysin 2; pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A2) (Answer E) are associated with an autosomal recessive syndrome of postnatal growth failure and short stature. Individuals homozygous or compound heterozygous for pathogenic variants in this gene present with postnatal growth failure with varying degrees of proportionate short stature. No major dysmorphic features have been described other than mild microcephaly and long, thin bones on x-ray. This patient’s parents are probably heterozygous and are unaffected. Given the presence of consanguinity in this family, the risk of autosomal recessive disorders is increased. The IGF-1 half-life is increased by its binding to IGFBPs (IGF-binding proteins) in circulation. Only free IGF-1 can interact with the IGF-1 receptor to induce biologic activity. PAPP-A2 is a metalloproteinase that releases IGF-1 from the complexes it forms with the binding proteins (mainly IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5). Inactivating pathogenic variants in PAPPA2, therefore, result in decreased levels of free IGF-1, leading to decreased linear growth. The absence of negative feedback of free IGF-1 on GH synthesis leads to an increase in GH production, which, in turn, induces an increase in the hepatic production of IGF-1, IGF-2, and IGFBP-3. Prenatal growth is dependent on IGF-1 and IGF-2. Fetal production of IGFs is largely independent from GH regulation except during the last few weeks of gestation. Normal maternal PAPP-A2 potentially maintains adequate free IGF levels in the fetus; therefore, no intrauterine growth failure occurs, which is consistent with this patient’s history of intrauterine growth that was adequate for gestational age based on birth weight. She has proportionate short stature as suggested by very similar measurements of arm span and height. Measurements of free IGF-1 would show low levels in her case. However, this test is only available in research laboratories and not yet in clinical practice. Loss-of-function pathogenic variants in the GHR gene (Answer A) are responsible for Laron-type dwarfism, also an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe postnatal growth failure. While GH levels may be elevated because of GH insensitivity, IGF-1 levels are low. Additionally, measurements of GH-binding protein, which represents the extracellular domain of the GH receptor, are low or undetectable. Gain-of-function pathogenic variants in the GHR gene (Answer B) have not been described, but they would theoretically result in an overgrowth syndrome. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5b is one of the proteins in the GH postreceptor cascade. Inactivating pathogenic variants in the STAT5B gene (Answer D) lead to a Laron-like syndrome with postnatal growth failure, immune deficiency manifested by frequent respiratory infections, normal GH-binding protein, and elevated GH levels but low IGF-1 levels. Inactivating pathogenic variants in the gene encoding the IGF-1 receptor (Answer C) are characterized by both prenatal and postnatal growth failure given that prenatal growth is dependent on IGF-1 and IGF-2 to which these individuals are unresponsive. Intrauterine growth is not dependent on GH, except for the last few weeks of gestation. GH therapy may induce a slight improvement in postnatal growth velocity, probably due to direct (ie, not mediated by IGF-1) action of GH on the growth plates.",

On physical examination, he is not jaundiced. His examination findings are normal. Newborn screening (sample drawn at 20 hours of life) documents a TSH value of 222.7 mIU/L (<29 mIU/L). Results of confirmatory testing: TSH (reference range: 0.34-5.60 mIU/L): >100 mIU/L (Day of life 4); 42.1 mIU/L (Day of life 8 - different assay for TSH).

        "options": "A. Measure TSH and T4 in 1 week (off levothyroxine) and measure the mother’s TSH and T4; B. Measure calcium and PTH; C. Start levothyroxine; D. Assess the mother’s thyroid antibodies ; E. Order thyroid ultrasonography", 
        "answer": "A. Measure TSH and T4 in 1 week (off levothyroxine) and measure the mother’s TSH and T4",
        "explanation": "With a TSH value greater than 100 mIU/L due to congenital hypothyroidism, one would expect a much lower total T4 or free T4 level. Without a firm diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism, starting levothyroxine (Answer C) would be incorrect and might prevent completion of the diagnostic evaluation, or in this case in which free and total T4 are elevated, it may result in overtreatment. Guidelines in Europe (European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology) and the United States (American Academy of Pediatrics, American Thyroid Association) do not directly address a scenario whereby total or free T4 is elevated. Further observation and testing is usually reserved for instances in which TSH is mildly elevated and T4 is normal. At this patient’s visit on day of life 8, he did not have jaundice, as might be expected in congenital hypothyroidism. Lower T4 is also expected in resistance to TSH in those who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for pathogenic variants in TSHR, and TSH is often not as high as in this case, although there is a wide range. Resistance to TSH can also be observed in Albright hereditary osteodystrophy with PTH resistance, but TSH is only mildly elevated in affected patients. Therefore, measuring calcium and PTH (Answer B) is incorrect. Mothers can transfer thyroid antibodies to the fetus, including TSH-receptor antibodies, which can block the TSH receptor and are expected to lead to high TSH and low or low-normal T4. In the right clinical setting, it is recommended to measure the level of such blocking antibodies in the baby. Therefore, assessing the mother’s thyroid antibodies (Answer D) is incorrect. Thyroid ultrasonography (Answer E) is helpful in distinguishing between cases of congenital hypothyroidism due to an ectopic gland vs a gland located in the normal position, but this is not indicated here, as the technetium nuclear scanning showed a normal-sized thyroid gland in the correct location. This baby had normal TSH receptor–binding inhibiting immunoglobulins. This suggests the possibility of abnormal TSH or assay interference. Although much has been talked about regarding the effects of biotin, this is not relevant in this scenario on day of life 4 and onwards, even if the mother had been taking biotin during pregnancy. Repeated laboratory tests using different TSH assays and methodologies have shown normal T4 levels associated with elevated TSH. On day of life 16, this baby’s TSH value was 27.4 mIU/L, and the total T4 value was 9.6 μg/dL (123.6 nmol/L) (same assay as the one used for testing on day of life 8). Testing to assess for evidence of interfering heterophile antibodies was negative. HAMA wash yielded the same result. Macro-TSH is a large circulating form of TSH composed of monomeric TSH complexed with autoimmune TSH antibodies. Macro-TSH can be detected on gel filtration chromatography with a prevalence ranging from 0.6% to 1.6%. Unlike TSH, which is a small bioactive hormone of 28 kDa easily filtered by the kidney, macro-TSH is a large molecule of at least 150 kDa that most likely accumulates in the circulation, resulting in measurements indicating falsely increased TSH levels. Currently, none of the available 2-site immunometric assays used for TSH testing can completely discriminate macro-TSH from bioactive free TSH, even if some platforms are more sensitive to its presence. Interference should be suspected in a patient with isolated TSH elevation (typically markedly elevated) with thyroid hormones in the upper half of the normal range and no signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction. An increased recovery of diluted samples showing nonlinearity may be indicative of macro-TSH. It should be noted, however, that the dilution procedure is neither specific nor sensitive. Lack of parallelism can be encountered with other interfering antibodies (eg, heterophilic antibodies). Gel filtration chromatography proved this patient had macro-TSH. Transplacental transfer of macro-TSH has been documented in neonates as a cause of falsely elevated TSH, which is why it is important to recheck the TSH and T4 levels a week later in the baby and in the mother (Answer A). Laboratory studies documented the following results in the patient’s mother: TSH = 16.42 mIU/L (0.5-4.30 mIU/L); Total T3 = 118 ng/dL (86-192 ng/dL) (SI: 1.8 nmol/L [1.3-3.0 nmol/L]); Total T4 = 9.0 μg/dL (4.5-12.0 μg/dL) (SI: 115.8 nmol/L [57.9-154.4 nmol/L]). At 6 weeks of life, the infant’s TSH concentration was still 21.4 mIU/L. Only at 7 months of life did it normalize, as the transplacental macro-TSH was washed out.",

He takes no prescription medications or illicit drugs. Over the past 6 weeks, his headaches have been much more severe and have been associated with palpitations and significant sweating. He was born at 30 weeks’ gestation and spent a short period in neonatal intensive care unit without long- term health problems. His vaccinations are up-to-date, and all developmental milestones are normal. His paternal grandfather has hypertension, which was diagnosed in his 50s. No other relevant family history is noted. Findings on cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and cutaneous examination are normal. Findings on thyroid examination are unremarkable and no goiter is palpable. His height is at the 50th percentile, and weight is at the 90th percentile. On the day of admission, he has 2 more seizures.

        "answer": "C. Measurement of urinary or plasma metanephrines",
        "explanation": "Urinary or plasma metanephrine measurement (Answer C) would be the most useful test to establish the presence of a pheochromocytoma and/or a catecholamine-secreting paraganglioma, which is the most likely diagnosis in view of the paroxysmal nature of the classic triad of symptoms (palpitations, diaphoresis, and headaches). Normal thyroid function test results and normal renal function exclude thyrotoxicosis and chronic renal disease as causes, which are on the list of differential diagnoses. Echocardiography (Answer A) could be useful to exclude a cardiac cause of hypertension such as aortic coarctation or to assess end-organ damage. Similarly, head MRI (Answer B) could be useful if Cushing disease were suspected or to assess the consequences of hypertension. However, neither of these options would be the next diagnostic investigation considering the symptomatology. MIBG scan (Answer D) and abdominal CT (Answer E) would be secondary investigations to locate the lesion following a biochemical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and/or catecholamine-secreting paraganglioma. The 24-hour urine metanephrine results in this case are: Analyte: Urine volume; Result: 961 mL; Reference Range: 0-4440 mL. Analyte: Normetanephrine; Result: 1765 μg/24 h (SI: 9637 nmol/d); Reference Range: 0-366 μg/24 h (SI: 0-2000 nmol/d). Analyte: Metanephrine; Result: 114 μg/24 h (SI: 579 nmol/d); Reference Range: 0-493 μg/24 h (SI: 0-2500 nmol/d). This patient had no phenotypic features of Cushing syndrome. MRI brain showed multifocal cortical deep white matter and basal ganglia edema predominantly within the basal ganglia, occipital lobes, and brain stem, findings consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Findings on echocardiography were normal, with an ejection fraction of 60% and no evidence of cardiomyopathy. MIBG scan showed avid uptake within the left adrenal gland, while abdominal CT showed a 4.1-cm lesion anterior to the left renal pelvis displacing the renal vessels. Phenoxybenzamine, 10 mg twice daily were initiated. He was discharged home on phenoxybenzamine, 20 mg 4 times daily, and propranolol, 4 times daily. He returned 2 weeks later for an elective left adrenalectomy and genetic testing. Pheochromocytomas and catecholamine-secreting paragangliomas are neuroendocrine tumors derived from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla or tumors that originate from the paraganglia of the autonomic nervous system. Pheochromocytomas and catecholamine-secreting paragangliomas account for 0.1% to 0.6% of cases of hypertension in adults and 1% of cases in pediatric patients. The reported incidence is 2 to 5 cases per million per year, of which 10% occur in children. Pheochromocytomas and catecholamine-secreting paragangliomas secrete catecholamines and other peptides. They cause morbidity and mortality through their secretory effects, mass effect, and/or malignant potential. The complete classic symptom triad of palpitations, diaphoresis, and headaches occurs in only 4% of patients, making the diagnosis difficult. Affected individuals can present with a wide range of symptoms, including anxiety, fatigue, weight loss, heat intolerance, vision disturbance, pallor, tremors, abdominal or chest pain, nausea, dizziness, change in bowel habits, neurologic symptoms, and worsening or new-onset diabetes. The episodic nature of symptoms with complete resolution between episodes should trigger a high index of clinical suspicion, and the diagnosis should be considered in all patients with sustained hypertension (60%-90% of pediatric cases), difficult-to-control hypertension, symptomatic hypertension, or a positive family history. Biochemical studies in the form of measuring 24-hour urinary metanephrines or plasma metanephrines are the first-line investigation to exclude pheochromocytomas and catecholamine-secreting paragangliomas. Careful evaluation is required in those with results in the upper-normal reference range. False-negative results are uncommon, except in cases of incomplete 24-hour urinary collection. Plasma metanephrines can be more reliable and convenient for this reason. However, false-positive results do occur. Medications including acetominophen, α- and β-adrenergic blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and sympathomimetic agents (nicotine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, cocaine) can all cause false-positive results. Circumstances of sample collection are also important. For plasma metanephrines, the patient should fast from midnight and be supine for 30 minutes before the blood test. The sample must be centrifuged within 2 hours. For urinary metanephrines, a complete 24-hour urine collection is required for accuracy. In both cases, patients should avoid common medications such as acetominophen and pseudoephedrine on the day of the test. Imaging and genetic testing are recommended once a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma or catecholamine-secreting paraganglioma is established. Currently, it is recognized that 40% to 50% of pheochromocytomas and catecholaminesecreting paragangliomas are due to underlying genetic pathogenic variants. These fall into 2 clusters of genes. Cluster 1 includes pathogenic variants in genes encoding the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), subunits of succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD), succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 2 (SDHAF2), fumarate hydratase (FH), malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2), and egl-9 family hypoxia inducible factors (EGLN1, EGLN2), which result in activation of hypoxia signaling pathways. Cluster 2 includes pathogenic variants in genes encoding neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), ret proto-oncogene (RET), transmembrane protein 127 (TMEM127), MYC-associated factor X (MAX), HRas protooncogene GTPase (HRAS), and endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1), which affect kinase receptor signaling pathways.",

        "explanation": "This patient presented with rapid growth, tall stature, galactorrhea, irregular menses, elevated prolactin, elevated GH, elevated IGF-1, failure of GH to suppress with oral glucose tolerance testing, and a sellar/suprasellar mass on MRI—findings consistent with a GH/prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma. First-line therapy for a GH/prolactin-secreting macroadenoma is surgical resection. However, this patient continued to have evidence of GH excess postoperatively and was therefore treated with a somatostatin analogue. Somatostatin is an inhibitory 14–amino acid peptide hormone present both in the hypothalamus and peripheral tissues. Somatostatin is involved in the inhibition of the release of GH and TSH, as well as gastrointestinal hormones, pancreatic enzymes, and neuropeptides. Somatostatin binds to receptors belonging to the 7 transmembrane G-protein–coupled receptor superfamily. Analogues of somatostatin, such as octreotide and lanreotide, were developed and initially used for the treatment of acromegaly and gastroenteropancreatic tumors and are highly effective for the treatment of GH excess. Because somatostatin inhibits TSH release, treatment with a somatostatin analogue (Answer C) is the most likely cause of this patient’s low TSH level. While destruction of thyrotrope cells can occur with a large mass (Answer A), this girl’s thyroid function tests were normal at presentation. Surgical resection (Answer B) could result in central hypothyroidism, gonadotropin deficiency, ACTH deficiency, and even diabetes insipidus. However, her thyroid function tests were normal postoperatively. Hyperprolactinemia and GH excess were present initially, but prolactin levels (Answer D) normalized postoperatively.

        "explanation": "Patients with hypoglycemia pose an interesting challenge to everyday clinical practice in endocrinology. GH deficiency, cortisol deficiency, and hyperinsulinemia could result in hypoglycemia. However, hepatomegaly (as evidenced by the protruding abdomen in this patient) and elevated lactate levels in the setting of hypoglycemia are seen in patients with glycogen storage disease (GSD). Elevated lactate levels and b-hydroxybutyrate with acidosis at the time of hypoglycemia in a patient with hepatomegaly are indications of possible GSD and warrant further metabolic workup and treatment. Patients with GSD type 1 also have hyperuricemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Therefore, measuring uric acid and performing a lipid panel (Answer A) is the best next step. GSD type 1 occurs in patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the genes encoding glucose-6-phosphatase (GSD type 1a) or glucose-6-phosphate translocase (GSD type 1b). Patients with GSD type 1 can present with hypoglycemia in the neonatal period, infancy, or early childhood, but more commonly present at 3 to 6 months of age. Clinical characteristics can mimic those of Cushing syndrome, including doll-like facies, poor growth, short stature, and a distended abdomen due to pronounced hepatomegaly and nephromegaly. Biochemical manifestations include hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperlactatemia, and hyperuricemia. Patients with GSD type 1b also have neutropenia and impaired neutrophil function, resulting in recurrent bacterial infections and oral and intestinal mucosa ulceration. Patients with GSD type 1 do not have skeletal myopathy or increased creatine kinase levels, which are characteristic of GSD type 3a. Frequent feeds with complex carbohydrates and cornstarch every 3 to 5 hours, as well as close monitoring of blood glucose levels, are essential in patients with GSD type 1. Long-acting cornstarch is approved for overnight use in children older than 5 years. In 2018, the US FDA approved the first gene therapy trial for patients with GSD type 1, which, if successful, could ultimately obviate the lifelong dependence on cornstarch for survival in these patients. GH and cortisol measured at the time of hypoglycemia may not be high enough to exclude GH deficiency and cortisol deficiency. Thus, in a patient with clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of a metabolic disorder such as GSD type 1, proceeding to expensive diagnostic testing such as MRI that could be also be invasive if it requires sedation given the patient’s age (Answer C) is incorrect. Proceeding with cosyntropin-stimulation testing (Answer B) or GH-simulation testing (Answer E) could delay the correct diagnosis or potentially result in wrong diagnosis and neither is the best next step. Follow-up in 6 months without further investigation and in-depth counseling on diet (Answer D) could be life-threatening in patients with GSD type 1 and is thus is not acceptable.",

Marfanoid habitus; high risk for metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma and ophthalmologic and skeletal manifestations; screening is recommended now.",
        "answer": "D. High risk for aggressive medullary thyroid carcinoma; total thyroidectomy is recommended now",
        "explanation": "The RET proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor of the tyrosine kinase family. It has a fundamental role in the development of sporadic or familial aggressive medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and other malignant and nonmalignant diseases. Genetic counseling and genetic testing for germline pathogenic variants in RET should be offered to first-degree relatives of patients with proven MTC or known RET pathogenic variants. In 2015, the American Thyroid Association published revised guidelines and changed the risk categories for MTC. Detailed information on risk classification of patients based on their RET pathogenic variant can be found in these guidelines. The highest-risk category includes patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2B and the RET codon M918T pathogenic variant. The high-risk category includes patients with RET pathogenic variants in codon 634 and the codon A883F pathogenic variant. Other common pathogenic variants, previously labeled as A and B categories, are now referred to as moderate-risk pathogenic variants. Patients with MEN 2B have marfanoid body habitus, narrow, long facies, generalized ganglioneuromatosis, skeletal malformations (usually pes cavus, although other skeletal malformations can be seen), and ophthalmologic abnormalities (ie, alacrima, prominent corneal nerve fibers across corneas, plexiform subconjunctival neuromas, conjunctival hyperemia with superficial peripheral corneal neovascularization, and blepharitis) (Answer E). The patient described in the vignette does not have the M918T pathogenic variant seen in 95% of patients with MEN 2B, and she also has a normal physical examination. Patients with a pathogenic variant in this codon require total thyroidectomy before the age of 1 year. For patients with the RET C634R pathogenic variant, it is recommended to screen for MTC with annual physical examination, cervical ultrasonography, and measurement of calcitonin starting at age 3 years. Studies have shown no lymph node metastasis in children with MEN 2A when the calcitonin level is below 30 or 40 pg/mL (<8.8 or 11.7 pmol/L). However, all patients with MEN 2A require total thyroidectomy. For children in the highrisk category, total thyroidectomy is recommended at or before age 5 years. The patient in this vignette is at high risk to have aggressive MTC. She is 7 years old, and total thyroidectomy ideally should have been done sooner. Therefore, this procedure is recommended now (Answer D). Patients with RET pathogenic variants at moderate risk should have total thyroidectomy in childhood or young adulthood, with the timing of operation being dependent primarily on calcitonin levels. Pheochromocytoma may develop before age 12 years in patients with MEN 2, although it has been reported as early as 8 years. Currently, it is recommended to start routine screening at age 11 years for patients in the high and highest-risk categories and at the age of 16 years for patients in the moderate-risk category, although earlier screening could be done based on clinical judgment. However, pheochromocytoma screening (Answer B) is not the best answer. Hyperparathyroidism has been reported to occur as early as 2, 6, 7, and 10 years of age in patients in the high and moderate-risk categories. However, current guidelines recommend screening by age 11 years for patients at high risk and by age 16 years for patients at moderate risk. Thus, screening for hyperparathyroidism (Answer A) is not the best choice. Patients with certain RET pathogenic variants are at risk for developing Hirschsprung disease and cutaneous lichen amyloidosis (Answer C). The RET C634R pathogenic variant is associated with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis. In patients with MEN 2A, this condition manifests as localized, interscapular amyloidosis, usually preceded by pruritus. Although she may develop this condition, her examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. Also, the RET C634R mutation is not associated with Hirschsprung disease. This patient’s calcitonin concentration was elevated at 109 pg/mL (31.8 pg/mL). She underwent total thyroidectomy and was found to have MTC with local invasion and angioinvasion, localized to the thyroid. Five lymph nodes were negative for carcinoma. Although she has a 20% probability of developing hyperparathyroidism and a 50% probability of developing pheochromocytoma, the priority now is to proceed with total thyroidectomy. Screening for pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism is recommended by age 11 years, although one could consider screening sooner if a patient has symptoms or abnormal vital signs.",

She began developing axillary hair and pubic hair at age 7 years. Her pediatrician is also concerned about short stature. The patient had an episode of vaginal bleeding 1 month ago, which lasted 6 days. Three weeks later, she had another episode of vaginal bleeding. She has no headaches or abdominal pain. She has not had a change in shoe or clothing size in the past year. Her energy level is normal. She does not take any medications or use any creams or lotions. Her midparental target height is 62 in (157.5 cm). On physical examination, her blood pressure is 81/57 mm Hg and pulse rate is 59 beats/min. Her height is 45.6 in (115.8 cm) (1st percentile; Z-score, –2.37), weight is 54.1 lb (24.6 kg) (33rd percentile; Z-score, –0.45), and BMI is 18.3 kg/m2 (83.8th percentile, Z-score, 0.99). She has some periorbital edema. Breasts are Tanner stage 2, and pubic hair is Tanner stage 2. The labia minora are prominent. Her visual fields are normal to confrontation.

        "answer": "B. LH low, TSH very high, hCG normal",
        "explanation": "LH, FSH, TSH, and hCG are glycoprotein hormones consisting of 2 chains, the α- and β-subunits, which are noncovalently bound. The α-subunits of LH, FSH, hCG, and TSH are identical in amino acid sequence (92 amino acids), although each of their β chains is unique and is responsible for the biologic specificity of the intact hormones. However, approximately 80% of the first 115 amino acids of the β-subunit of hCG is homologous to the sequence of the β-subunit of LH. This girl presented with early pubertal changes with rapid progression to vaginal bleeding but slow linear growth. Her examination findings are notable for short stature, normal weight, presence of secondary sexual characteristics, periorbital edema, and hypertrichosis. Her bone age is delayed. These findings are consistent with primary hypothyroidism leading to the so-called overlap or Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome. In this scenario, TSH would be markedly elevated, LH would be low, and hCG would be normal (Answer B). FSH levels can be normal or elevated. One theory to explain the mechanism that occurs in Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome is thought to be related to a markedly elevated TSH concentration exerting FSH-like effects at the FSH receptor, via the common α-subunit, leading to an increase in gonadal size and steroidogenesis. The isolated rise in FSH is postulated to be from slowing of the GnRH pulse frequency in primary hypothyroidism. The low LH may be due to hyperprolactinemia from increased thyrotropin-releasing hormone leading to decreased GnRH secretion. In girls, the increase in estrogen from the ovaries leads to breast development and uterine bleeding in the absence of pubic and axillary hair development. The patient in this vignette did have pubic hair development; however, this can be normal for age. In boys, testicular enlargement without other signs of virilization is seen. Gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty, in which LH and FSH would be increased for age and TSH and hCG would be normal (Answer A), would be expected to cause linear growth acceleration, tall stature, and advanced bone age. Granulosa-cell tumors of the ovary, in which estradiol levels would be high, with suppressed LH and FSH levels and normal TSH and hCG levels (Answer C), usually present with rapid onset of pubertal changes and vaginal bleeding but would not be expected to be associated with short stature, periorbital edema, or hypertrichosis. A germ-cell tumor of the central nervous system, in which hCG levels are elevated and LH levels are low, can manifest with early pubertal changes. However, this phenomenon is only seen in boys. hCG and LH share the same receptor, so elevations in hCG would be expected to result in secondary sexual characteristics in boys due to stimulation of Leydig cells, with subsequent testosterone production. However, in girls, both LH (or hCG) and FSH are needed for ovarian estradiol production. A germ-cell tumor of the central nervous system would also not be likely to have an elevated TSH level as in Answer D. Low LH, low FSH, low TSH, and normal hCG (Answer E) might be seen in a girl with McCune-Albright syndrome who has gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty and hyperthyroidism due to constitutive activation of the G-protein–stimulatory subunit. Linear growth acceleration with bone age advancement would be expected in this scenario. Also, this patient has no evidence of café-au-lait macules or fibrous dysplasia on examination.",

She has had no vomiting, changes in stool pattern, or fevers. Laboratory test results prior to the onset of these acute symptoms have been normal. She has a history of hypothyroidism secondary to iodine deficiency and has been off levothyroxine for 3 months following normalization of urine iodine levels with potassium-iodine supplementation. On physical examination in the emergency department, she is a tired-appearing girl with dry, brittle hair and dry skin. She has tachycardia, muscle spasms, and cramping. Her thyroid gland is normal on examination. Laboratory test results: Potassium = 3.4 mEq/L (3.3-4.7 mEq/L) (SI: 3.4 mmol/L [3.3-4.7 mmol/L]); Carbon dioxide = 29 mEq/L (17-31 mEq/L) (SI: 29 mmol/L (17-31 mmol/L]); Creatinine = 0.32 mg/dL (0.17-0.42 mg/dL) (SI: 28.3 μmol/L [15.0-37.1 μmol/L]); Calcium = 7.0 mg/dL (8.5-10.1 mg/dL) (SI: 1.8 mmol/L [2.1-2.5 mmol/L]); Phosphate = 5.4 mg/dL (3.7-6.5 mg/dL) (SI: 1.7 mmol/L [1.2-2.1 mmol/L]); Magnesium = 0.8 mg/dL (1.7-2.4 mg/dL) (SI: 0.3 mmol/L [0.7-1.0 mmol/L]); Albumin = 3.1 g/dL (3.5-4.7 g/dL) (SI: 31 g/L [35-47 g/L]); PTH = 40 pg/mL (15-87 pg/mL) (SI: 40 ng/L [15-87 ng/L]).

        "options": "A. Impaired magnesium absorption due to pathogenic variants in the TRPM6 gene; B. Calcium deficiency secondary to hypoparathyroidism; C. Iodine deficiency causing hypothyroidism; D. Magnesium deficiency secondary to inadequate supplementation; E. Gitelman syndrome.",
        "answer": "D. Magnesium deficiency secondary to inadequate supplementation",
        "explanation": "Magnesium is a divalent cation (as is calcium) essential for both the secretion and function of PTH. In this clinical scenario, the patient has symptoms of profound tetany despite a corrected calcium of 7.7 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L). PTH is exquisitely sensitive to calcium changes. Thus, the value of 40 pg/mL (40 ng/L) is lower than expected. However, this is due to the profound hypomagnesemia impairing the function of the calcium-sensing receptor. Acquired hypoparathyroidism (Answer B) is theoretically possible, but it would require ongoing treatment with calcium and calcitriol and would not resolve with magnesium supplementation alone. In addition, hypoparathyroidism is associated with hyperphosphatemia and an increased fractional excretion of calcium in the urine, neither of which is present in this patient. Rare autosomal recessive pathogenic variants in the TRPM6 gene (Answer A) on chromosome 9q22 cause hypomagnesemia with impaired urinary magnesium excretion. Affected patients present with symptoms of seizures and tetany in the first few weeks of life. Despite having a congenital malabsorption syndrome, her bowel pattern has not changed, and calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels have previously been normal. Gitelman syndrome (Answer E) is due to a defect in the sodium-chloride channel causing impaired resorption of several electrolytes at the distal tubule of the kidney. Laboratory findings include hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hypocalciuria, and hypomagnesemia due to renal magnesium wasting. Affected patients generally present in later childhood with symptoms of muscle weakness, lethargy, muscle cramps, and tetany. Because most calcium reabsorption is mediated by the calcium-sensing receptor thick ascending loop of Henle, these patients have low urinary calcium excretion in contrast to patients with Bartter syndrome. This patient’s pathogenic variants in SPINT2 cause intractable watery diarrhea and tufting of enterocytes, leading to malabsorption and metabolic acidosis with resultant intestinal failure. Affected patients also present with woolly hair, intrauterine growth restriction, short stature, immunodeficiency, skin abnormalities, and liver disease. While enteric magnesium losses are possible at diagnosis, she has not had any changes in her bowel habits, and prior electrolyte measurements have been normal. Shortages of various electrolytes and micronutrients have been known to cause significant clinical consequences if patients are not carefully monitored. Patients on total parenteral nutrition are at risk for hypothyroidism due to iodine deficiency, which has been a previous concern for this patient. Iodine deficiency (Answer C) can cause fatigue, weakness, dry brittle hair, and dry skin, but it would not be expected to cause hypomagnesemia. Her TSH level was also checked and was normal. At the time of this patient’s episode, there was a national shortage of magnesium. Because she was receiving some nutrition enterally, she was not identified as an at-risk patient despite her history of malabsorption. This led to both calcium and magnesium mineral supplementation being removed from her parenteral nutrition 2 weeks before her presentation (Answer D).",

        "answer": "D. Apolipoprotein B",
        "explanation": "Polycystic ovary syndrome is a known metabolic disorder associated with insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Women with this condition often have metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is characterized by a group of cardiovascular risk factors, including central obesity, high blood pressure, elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol (thus, Answer E is incorrect), and elevated fasting glucose. In pediatric patients, metabolic syndrome is most often diagnosed according to criteria that are adapted from adult criteria, such as those developed by the National Cholesterol Education Program. The most commonly used criteria specify the following cutoff values: - Fasting blood glucose = typically >100 mg/dL (SI: >5.5 mmol/L); - HDL cholesterol = <40 mg/dL (SI: <1.04 mmol/L); - Triglycerides = >110 mg/dL (SI: >1.24 mmol/L); - Blood pressure greater than the 90th percentile for sex, age, and height; - Waist circumference greater than the 90th percentile for age and sex. To be classified as having metabolic syndrome, an adolescent must have abnormal values for at least 3 of these 5 criteria. Polycystic ovary syndrome contributes to the metabolic derangements with hyperandrogenemia, which has been associated with enhanced lipogenesis. While patients with polycystic ovary syndrome often have insulin resistance (Answer A), recent studies support the idea that the presence of elevated apolipoprotein B (Answer D), such as intestinal apolipoprotein B48 and hepatic apolipoprotein B100, are strong predictors of future cardiovascular disease. Increased lipid synthesis via increased activation of the nuclear transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c is also a strong predictor of future cardiovascular disease. African American patients appear to manifest metabolic syndrome differently than white and Hispanic patients. Black patients with metabolic syndrome are much less likely to exhibit elevated triglycerides. In a survey of 2456 adolescents, Johnson et al documented that although 26% to 32% of white and Hispanic adolescents had triglyceride concentrations above 110 mg/dL (>1.24 mmol/L), only 10% of black adolescents exhibited triglyceride elevations (Answer C), potentially because of lower levels of lipoprotein lipase. LDL-cholesterol elevations (Answer B) are not significantly associated with metabolic syndrome. The mainstay of treatment for metabolic syndrome and related abnormalities is lifestyle modification with increased physical activity and decreased caloric intake. However, metformin therapy has been associated with improvements in a number of the metabolic derangements noted in polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescent and adult women.",

        "answer": "E. FNA biopsy of both nodules",
        "explanation": "The most common form of well-differentiated thyroid cancer is papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Because PTC is usually multifocal, it is crucial to determine via FNA biopsy if a thyroid nodule represents PTC. While more adults than children have thyroid nodules, thyroid nodules in children are more likely to be malignant. In pediatric patients, all instances of FNA biopsy should be ultrasound-guided. In this case, although the 2 nodules are in the left thyroid lobe, removing the left lobe alone (Answer A) is incorrect. If this patient has PTC, she would need completion thyroidectomy surgery. Although evaluating whether this patient has Hashimoto thyroiditis (Answer B) could be done, it is not the best next step. Even if she has autoimmune thyroiditis, one would still need to perform FNA biopsy to determine whether she has thyroid cancer. The ultrasonography features of thyroid nodules can indicate whether a nodule is likely to be malignant. Performing FNA biopsy of only the largest nodule (Answer C) is incorrect, as the smaller nodule could be malignant as well. In this case, the smaller nodule has a few features that confer a higher risk of malignancy: solid and hypoechoic composition, taller-than-wide shape, increased blood flow, and a possible microcalcification. Ultrasonography images of various thyroid nodules, illustrating the features of very low, low, intermediate, and high suspicion for risk of malignancy in thyroid nodules are depicted well in the adult American Thyroid Association guidelines from 2015. The same features apply when evaluating nodules in pediatric patients. While the smaller lesion has some high-risk features, performing FNA biopsy on this lesion alone (Answer D) is incorrect, as this patient requires assessment for multifocal disease. Irregular margins—another high-risk feature—were not present. Having cervical adenopathy also raises the suspicion of thyroid cancer, but this was not noted on ultrasonography or physical examination in this patient. When performing FNA biopsy on the larger lesion in this adolescent, ultrasound guidance should aim to sample the solid areas of the lesion where malignancy is more likely. For a complete evaluation, this patient should undergo ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy of both lesions (Answer E).",

        "answer": "E. Discuss switching from risperidone to another atypical antipsychotic with her psychiatrist",
        "explanation": "Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses for 3 consecutive cycles after menarche. Physiologic causes of secondary amenorrhea include functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, pregnancy, and lactation. An elevated prolactin level in a patient with secondary amenorrhea raises concern for pathologic causes such as prolactin-secreting adenomas, sellar masses, pituitary stalk disruption, and primary hypothyroidism. Patients with psychiatric disorders are at higher risk of amenorrhea or menstrual irregularities, most likely related to hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. First-generation antipsychotic agents and the atypical antipsychotic risperidone can increase prolactin levels via dopamine receptor antagonism. Compared with risperidone, other atypical antipsychotics (serotonin-dopamine antagonists) and partial dopamine antagonists (ie, aripiprazole) are associated with lower serum prolactin levels. Switching from risperidone to another atypical antipsychotic (Answer E) may help resolve amenorrhea without worsening psychiatric symptoms, but this should only be undertaken after discussion with the prescribing physician. If an elevated prolactin value is documented, current guidelines recommend discontinuing medications that are known to increase prolactin before performing additional testing. While the cause of this patient’s amenorrhea and hyperprolactinemia is most likely risperidone, this cannot be assumed without further assessment, so simply providing reassurance (Answer D) is incorrect. A pituitary MRI (Answer A) would be recommended only if the antipsychotic medication cannot be discontinued or if the prolactin level remains above 50 ng/mL (>2.2 nmol/L) after switching medications. This patient also has findings of mild hirsutism and a mild elevation in free testosterone, which could be caused by polycystic ovary syndrome or nonclassic CAH. While further workup for these conditions should be considered (Answer B), the first priority is to assess the elevated prolactin level. It is expected that menses would resume if the prolactin level decreases below 50 ng/mL (<2.2 nmol/L). Thus, if menses do not resume, additional testing would be indicated. A progestin withdrawal challenge (Answer C) would not add useful diagnostic information at this point given that her estrogen level is normal. Initial laboratory test results were reviewed with this patient’s psychiatrist, who switched her medication from risperidone to aripiprazole. Testing 4 weeks later showed that her prolactin level decreased to 24.6 ng/mL (1.1 nmol/L). Her hyperprolactinemia was therefore attributed to risperidone.",

Reassure the patient and recommend no changes in insulin dosage.",
        "answer": "D. Recommend a small insulin bolus before lifting weights",
        "explanation": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a challenging condition to manage with various physiologic changes of the human body. Regular exercise is essential, but management of different forms of physical activity is particularly challenging for both the individual with type 1 diabetes and the health care provider. Daily exercise is highly encouraged for patients with type 1 diabetes, as it is the best practice to recommend for any patient. Patients with type 1 diabetes benefit from exercise by improving glycemic control, as well as body composition and general well-being. However, different types and intensities of exercise have various effects on blood glucose concentrations. Understanding the metabolic and neuroendocrine responses to various types of exercise is essential to offer proper advice to patients. During aerobic exercise, insulin secretion decreases and glucagon secretion increases in the portal vein to facilitate release of glucose from the liver to match the rate of glucose uptake into the working muscles. During predominantly anaerobic activities such as sprinting and during a high-intensity training session such as weight lifting, circulating insulin concentrations do not decrease as markedly as in purely aerobic activities, in part because the duration of activity is typically shorter. Insulin concentrations increase above baseline in early recovery from a high-intensity training session to offset the rise in glucose caused by the elevations in counterregulatory hormones and other metabolites. Blood glucose levels tend to remain steady or drop precipitously in patients with diabetes during aerobic forms of exercise such as biking, hiking, walking, and rollerblading, depending on the amount of active insulin on board (basal and/or bolus). However, in most anaerobic forms of exercise such as weight lifting, blood glucose rises since the insulin dose is mostly adjusted for the resting state. This can be prevented by giving a small dose (30%-50% less) of a blood glucose correction bolus (or half of the hourly basal rate) before the anaerobic exercise (Answer D). Not trusting a patient’s reporting by suspecting erroneous glucose measurements and requesting another report in 1 week (Answer A) could alienate the patient. Increasing the basal insulin dose by 20% before and during exercise (temporary basal rate) would most likely provide a similar solution if the patient is managed via insulin pump therapy. However, increasing the daily basal insulin by 20% (Answer B) would increase the risk of hypoglycemia throughout the day. Increasing the insulin bolus for the meal before lifting weights (Answer C) may cause hypoglycemia depending on the timing of the meal and should not be recommended. Reassurance (Answer E) will send the wrong message to the patient in terms of tolerating hyperglycemia and would increase the risk of ketosis during anaerobic exercise.",

He lives with his grandmother (his legal guardian). The family history is not fully obtainable. His father’s height is 67 in (170.2 cm), and his mother’s height is 60 in (152.4 cm). Midparental target height is 66 ± 4 in (168 ± 10 cm). On physical examination, his height is 53 in (134.6 cm) (SDS, –1.94), weight is 87.3 lb (39.7 kg) (SDS, +0.84), and BMI is 24.2 kg/m2 (97th percentile; SDS, +1.98). He is obese and has a stocky build. Vital signs are normal. Six-year molars are present. No thyroid gland enlargement is noted. Pubic hair and genitalia are Tanner stage 1. Testicular volume is 2 to 3 mL bilaterally. Bone age is interpreted to be markedly advanced at 15 years at a chronologic age of 10 years 5 months with fusion of epiphyses of all distal phalanges. Laboratory test results: Calcium = 8.0 mg/dL (8.8-10.8 mg/dL) (SI: 2.0 mmol/L [2.2-2.7 mmol/L]); Phosphate = 6.2 mg/dL (2.3-4.5 mg/dL) (SI: 2.0 mmol/L [0.7-1.5 mmol/L]); Total protein = 8.5 g/dL (6.0-8.0 g/dL) (SI: 85 g/L [60-80 g/L]); Albumin = 5.0 g/dL (3.8-5.4 g/dL) (SI: 50 g/L [38-54 g/L]); Alkaline phosphatase = 181 U/L (<400 IU/L) (SI: 3.0 μkat/L [<6.7 μkat/L]); AST = 46.0 U/L (<40.0 U/L) (SI: 0.77 μkat/L [<0.67 μkat/L]); ALT = 24.0 U/L (<40.0 U/L) (SI: 0.40 μkat/L [<0.67 μkat/L]); Free T4 = 0.79 ng/dL (0.8-1.7 ng/dL) (SI: 10.2 pmol/L [10.3-21.9 pmol/L]); TSH = 5.9 mIU/L (0.7-5.7 mIU/L); Total T3 = 109.0 ng/dL (123.0-211.0 ng/dL) (SI: 1.7 nmol/L [1.9-3.2 nmol/L]); PTH = 169 pg/mL (10-65 pg/mL) (SI: 169 ng/L [10-65 ng/L]).",

        "answer": "E. Shortened fourth metacarpals and metatarsals",
        "explanation": "The description of the child in this vignette most closely matches a diagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A (Albright hereditary osteodystrophy). Therefore, of the physical findings listed, the classic finding of shortened fourth metacarpals and metatarsals (Answer E) is the most likely to be observed. He has additional physical manifestations consistent with this disorder, including short stature, stocky build, obesity, and cognitive impairment/developmental delay. His workup shows mild hypocalcemia with slight hyperphosphatemia, as well as elevated PTH, which suggests the presence of PTH dysfunction. The history of seizures in infancy is most likely the result of hypocalcemia. Manifestations of pseudohypoparathyroidism include a spectrum of abnormal physical features, neurocognitive deficiencies, and endocrine abnormalities that are most commonly caused by the defective hormonal signaling for those hormones that act through G protein–coupled receptors. Loss-of-function pathogenic variants in the gene encoding the α subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gsα) lead to lack of activation of the postreceptor cascade after interaction of the hormone (ligand) with the G protein–coupled receptor (receptor), thus leading to hormone resistance. As such, individuals with pseudohypoparathyroidism have primarily functional hypoparathyroidism with elevated PTH levels because of resistance to PTH leading to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. They may also present with hypothyroidism due to resistance to TSH, hypogonadism due to resistance to LH and FSH, and GH deficiency due to resistance to GHRH. Physical manifestations of pseudohypoparathyroidism include short stature, stocky build, early-onset obesity, skeletal deformities (most commonly brachydactyly), ectopic ossifications (not described in the vignette), premature closure of growth plates, and neurocognitive abnormalities (eg, developmental delay and loss of intellectual function). Almond-shaped eyes (Answer A) are commonly associated with Prader-Willi syndrome. This condition is also associated with short stature but not commonly with thyroid dysfunction or PTH abnormalities. Focal dysplasia of the distal radial physis (Answer B), or Madelung deformity, is often seen in patients with SHOX pathogenic variants. Affected patients uniformly have short stature, but they do not have associated thyroid or calcium disturbances. Noonan syndrome is associated with widely-spaced eyes, eyelid ptosis, and low-set ears (Answer C). Patients with Noonan syndrome commonly present with a heart murmur or developmental delays. They do not have thyroid or calcium abnormalities. Silver-Russell syndrome is associated with short stature and hemihypertrophy (Answer D).

Findings on adrenal CT and MRI are reportedly normal.",
        "question": "Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "options": "A. Renal artery stenosis; B. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia; C. Liddle syndrome; D. Adrenal adenoma; E. Licorice root ingestion.",
        "answer": "D. Adrenal adenoma",
        "explanation": "An adrenal adenoma (Answer D) is the most likely diagnosis in this case, although glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism (not given as an option) should be excluded. Glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism is an autosomal dominant form of hyperaldosteronism due a genetic defect that gives rise to fusion of the promoter region of the CYP11A1 gene with the coding sequences of the CYP11B2 gene (encoding aldosterone synthase), resulting in a chimeric CYP11A1/CYP11B2 gene. As a result, aldosterone synthase is expressed in cortisol-producing zona fasciculata cells, and excess aldosterone is secreted in response to endogenous plasma ACTH. Biochemically, this causes a picture of low-renin hypertension with aldosterone excess. Treatment with dexamethasone to suppress ACTH did not alter this patient’s serum aldosterone levels, which rules out glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism. When this patient’s CT images (which were initially reported as normal) were reviewed at a specialist center, a 10-mm nodule at the apex of the left adrenal gland was noted. A repeated scan demonstrated a stable lesion with no changes in size. Due to the washout characteristics of 40%, the lesion was thought to be a lipid-poor adenoma. The renal arteries were normal, as were the kidneys and left adrenal gland. The patient underwent a left-sided adrenalectomy. Macroscopically, a homogenous bright yellow nodule measuring approximately 14 Å~ 12 Å~ 4 mm was present without necrosis or hemorrhage, thus confirming a diagnosis of adrenal cortical adenoma. Postoperatively, the patient’s blood pressure normalized and all medications were subsequently stopped. Genetic analysis did not reveal any germline pathogenic variants in known genes, but analysis of the adenoma itself revealed a heterozygous somatic gain-of-function pathogenic variant (T158A) in the KCNJ5 gene. The KCNJ5 gene encodes the potassium channel Kir 3.4 (potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 5). Gain-of-function KCNJ5 pathogenic variants, both somatic and germline, cluster in the selectivity filter of Kir3.4, and as such, lead to changes in ion selectivity, increased sodium conductance, and cell depolarization. This opens voltage-dependent calcium channels and influx of calcium in zona glomerulosa cells, resulting in constitutive secretion of aldosterone and cell proliferation. Renal artery stenosis (Answer A) results in activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to elevated renin levels. In this case, renin is completely suppressed, which excludes renal artery stenosis as a diagnosis. Hypertension is a feature of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (Answer B), in particular 11β-hydroxylase deficiency and 17α-hydroxylase deficiency. However, this is due to the excess production of 11-deoxycorticosterone acting on the mineralocorticoid receptor, leading to a low renin and low aldosterone state. Liddle syndrome (Answer C) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by pathogenic variants in the sodium channel epithelial 1 β and γ subunit genes (SCNN1B and SCNN1G), which encode the subunits that make up the epithelial sodium channel. Pathogenic variants lead to constitutive activation of sodium reabsorption along with water retention and increased potassium excretion. Liddle syndrome is biochemically associated with low plasma renin activity, low blood potassium, and normal to low levels of aldosterone. Licorice root ingestion (Answer E) mimics true hyperaldosteronism, but aldosterone levels are low, so this is an incorrect diagnosis in this case. The prevalence of hypertension (primary and secondary) in children is reported to be between 4.5% and 13%. Secondary causes are more common in children than in adults. In one study, secondary causes account for 57% of all pediatric hypertension cases. Of these, more than 50% of hypertension cases are due to renal disease, while endocrine causes account for approximately 10%. Endocrine causes include primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, Cushing syndrome, acromegaly, hyperparathyroidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and renin-secreting tumors. The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism is made biochemically by documenting elevated aldosterone together with a low or undetectable plasma renin activity. The Endocrine Society guidelines suggest 2 separate measurements to confirm the diagnosis, except in cases where there is spontaneous hypokalemia, a plasma aldosterone concentration greater than 19.8 ng/dL (>550 pmol/L), and plasma renin activity below detectable limits. Adrenal venous sampling is recommended to distinguish between unilateral or bilateral disease. In this child, adrenal venous sampling was considered, but it was deemed unnecessary due to marked primary aldosteronism, his young age, and positive CT findings. Genetic testing is also recommended in patients with confirmed primary aldosteronism who are younger than 20 years, in those with a family history of primary aldosteronism, or in patients who experience stroke at an age younger than 40 years. Unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy for patients with documented unilateral primary aldosteronism is the treatment of choice. Medical treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, usually spironolactone, should be considered if surgery is not possible or in cases of bilateral disease.",

Perform DXA to evaluate bone health.",
        "answer": "A. Discuss the adverse effects of her cancer therapy and have her return for follow-up in 6 months",
        "explanation": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is rare and accounts for less than 1% of all leukemias in children. Use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the treatment of CML has significantly improved the life expectancy of adults and children. Since the first-generation TKI imatinib was approved for CML therapy in 2003, several new TKI agents have emerged such as dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib. These potent agents are taken orally and target the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. Because children with CML require lifelong TKI therapy, there is concern for potential off-target inhibition of other kinases leading to long-term adverse effects. TKIs may inhibit the GHRH signaling cascade, GH signaling cascade, and IGF-1 signal transduction, resulting in GH deficiency or resistance. TKIs may also inhibit chondrocyte activity in growth plates. Many patients have a significant decrease in their prepubertal growth, but experience catch-up growth during puberty. Thus, the best course of action is to discuss the adverse effects of her cancer therapy and have her return for follow-up in 6 months (Answer A). Use of GH during active malignancy is contraindicated because of concerns of neoplasia risks. Thus, further research is needed to assess whether GH therapy (Answer C) can be safely used in patients with CML on TKI therapy who have poor growth due to GH deficiency or GH resistance. TKIs are associated with subclinical and overt primary hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Mechanisms by which TKIs result in thyroid dysfunction are unclear, but they are thought to be related to increased clearance, decreased iodine uptake, thyroiditis, and TPO inhibition. Thus, it is important to ensure thyroid function is normal before starting TKIs and to periodically monitor thyroid function—usually twice a year—while on TKI therapy. This patient had normal free T4 and TSH levels documented 1 week before the clinic visit. Thus, it is not necessary to prescribe levothyroxine at this time (Answer B). Because children on TKI therapy for CML tend to have catchup growth during puberty, it is expected that this patient’s growth will improve, as she is in early puberty now. She will not necessarily have short stature as an adult (Answer D). TKIs lead to dysregulation in bone remodeling by inhibiting the activity of c-FMS, the macrophage colonystimulating factor receptor, on osteoclasts and PDGF-R (platelet-derived growth factor receptor) and c-Abl1 on osteoblasts. TKIs may promote bone formation in adults, but they cause bone demineralization in children. TKIs also alter calcium and phosphate metabolism, resulting in hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia. It is important to optimize bone health in these patients. However, DXA (Answer E) is not warranted unless the patient has an unprovoked fracture or is noted to have low bone mineral density on plain radiographs.",

        "answer": "E. Start thyroid hormone replacement and measure TSH and free T4 again in 2 weeks",
        "explanation": "The overall incidence of congenital hypothyroidism is 1 in 3000, although the incidence seems to be rising. Congenital hypothyroidism is one of the most preventable causes of intellectual disability. Therefore, newborn screening aims to identify children with this condition to initiate treatment as soon as possible. Usually, newborn screening identifies babies with congenital hypothyroidism based on elevated TSH in the first 24 to 48 hours of life, with or without a low T4 level. However, in preterm babies, there is an atypical form of congenital hypothyroidism characterized by a delayed rise in TSH. The fetal thyroid gland produces thyroid hormones around the end of the first trimester; however, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is not mature until after birth, and both TSH and thyroid hormone levels increase during gestation. Following delivery, there is a TSH surge in term infants, to about 60 to 80 mIU/L, which declines to about 20 mIU/L at 24 to 48 hours of life and to 6 to 10 mIU/L by 1 week of age. In premature babies, this pattern also occurs, but the thyroid hormone levels reached are reduced compared with those of full-term newborns. In most preterm babies, the levels eventually improve over time, and a rise in TSH and T4 is seen as they recover from the several factors causing hypothyroxinemia of prematurity. However, in some babies with congenital hypothyroidism, extreme prematurity, and low birth weight, the TSH rise may not be seen before the age of 30 days (delayed TSH rise). These babies will not be diagnosed by routine TSH-based newborn screening. Several studies have confirmed that preterm infants are at higher risk to have congenital hypothyroidism, which may be missed by routine newborn screening. Vigone et al found that in preterm infants with a birth weight of 640 to 1975 g, only 5 of 24 newborns with congenital hypothyroidism were identified by initial newborn screening, while the other 19 were detected by second or third screening performed between 15 and 30 days of life. This is similar to the study of Kaluarachchi et al, which showed that of 26 premature infants found to have thyroid dysfunction, only 3 were detected by newborn screening, while the others were detected when TSH and free T4 were routinely obtained at 30 days of life. In a larger study, Hunter et al also documented that 63 infants were missed by initial newborn screening due to delayed TSH rise. A study by Tfayli et al confirmed similar data showing a late TSH surge in very low–birth weight infants (<1500 g) in Lebanon. The ideal timing for second or third screening in this population is debated, and it has been generally thought that the delayed TSH rise can be captured at 30 days of life. Other areas of debate are the TSH cutoff at this time and whether to consider treatment vs follow-up—no data are available on whether lack of treatment of mildly elevated TSH levels on the second or third screening is harmful. Most experts agree with continuing treatment until age 2 or 3 years. A recent systematic review of screening of congenital hypothyroidism in preterm, low–birth weight, and very low–birth weight neonates recommends careful interpretation of thyroid function studies in this population. The authors recommend screening with TSH and free T4 levels in the second, sixth, and tenth weeks of life and treating if the TSH concentration is 20 mIU/L or greater. They also recommend treating if any TSH value is greater than 10 mIU/L with a free T4 value below 0.7 ng/dL (<9.0 pmol/L) during the third to sixth weeks of life and any TSH value between 10 and 20 mIU/L with a normal free T4 level on 2 occasions. A recent study in Ireland found that if TSH measurement had been repeated at 2 weeks of life only, 48% of cases with congenital hypothyroidism would have been missed. If the final screen had occurred at 4 weeks of life, 26% cases would have been missed. The authors recommend screening on days 3 to 5, at 1 week, at 2 weeks, at 4 weeks, and at term-corrected gestational age. Although there is no consensus on when to screen premature and very low-birth weight newborns, it is important to be aware of this form of congenital hypothyroidism with delayed TSH surge and the importance of monitoring this fragile population to protect and maximize their brain development. The patient in this vignette is a premature newborn with very low-birth weight and TSH concentration greater than 20 mIU/L at 4 weeks of life. This baby most likely has congenital hypothyroidism with delayed TSH surge and would benefit from treatment at this time, with close follow-up (Answer E). Although some clinicians may want to confirm results before starting treatment, waiting 4 weeks (Answer A) would most likely delay needed treatment in this infant. Assessing antibodies in the mother (Answer B) would not change management. In addition, there is no maternal history of thyroid dysfunction and determining whether the baby’s hypothyroidism is transient could be reevaluated in the future. Measuring TSH, free T4 by equilibrium dialysis, and total T3 (Answer C) would be more appropriate when evaluating an infant for hypothyroxinemia with a normal TSH level to differentiate among central hypothyroidism, nonthyroidal illness, or low thyroxine-binding globulin. However, this would not change management in this setting. Although recovery from nonthyroidal illness is in the differential diagnosis for this patient, the TSH value above 20 mIU/L with a low-normal free T4 concentration is more suggestive of congenital hypothyroidism with delayed TSH surge. Reassurance and no intervention and no follow-up with thyroid function studies (Answer E) would be incorrect. If no intervention is elected at this time, very close follow-up with repeated TSH and free T4 measurements is recommended.",

        "explanation": "This patient presented with recurrent cystic growth of a craniopharyngioma. Although her pituitary function was initially normal, with subsequent surgeries she developed panhypopituitarism, central diabetes insipidus, and hypothalamic obesity. Patients with lesions of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus can present with hormone deficiencies preoperatively, during surgery, postoperatively, or following cranial irradiation. Central diabetes insipidus occurs due to dysfunction of the vasopressinergic neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion is regulated by plasma and interstitial osmotic pressure sensed by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, as well as by circulating blood volume, sensed by baroreceptors. Plasma osmolality is normally maintained in a relatively narrow physiologic range by water intake and output regulated by AVP and thirst. Like AVP, thirst is stimulated by hyperosmolality. The osmoreceptors that regulate thirst are in close proximity to those regulating AVP. Adipsia (inappropriate lack of thirst) typically results from lesions that impair thirst and AVP secretion (eg, structural abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary region due to congenital malformations such as optic nerve hypoplasia, septo-optic dysplasia, holoprosencephaly, tumors such as craniopharyngioma, trauma, and surgery). This patient initially had normal thirst. Postoperatively, her sodium was normal at first. However, when she was allowed to take fluids ad lib, she became hypernatremic. This patient most likely developed unrecognized adipsia (Answer B) as a result of the surgery. Excess fluid administration (Answer A) is a common cause of postoperative polyuria, but it is unlikely to cause hypernatremia if there is normal kidney function and thirst. Her serum urea nitrogen and creatinine remained normal, so excess fluid administration is incorrect. Symptoms of diabetes insipidus can be masked by glucocorticoid deficiency until cortisol replacement is administered. However, this patient already had a known diagnosis of ACTH deficiency and central diabetes insipidus, and her diabetes insipidus had been well controlled on her home desmopressin and hydrocortisone dosages. Additionally, if her thirst mechanism were intact, she would have been able to avoid hypernatremia by increasing her fluid intake. Therefore, stress doses of hydrocortisone worsening the diabetes insipidus (Answer C) is incorrect. Hyperglycemia is a common cause of polyuria, but not hypernatremia (Answer D). She did have some mild postoperative hyperglycemia, but her glucose levels were not elevated enough to cause significant increases in urine output and subsequent dehydration. At home she had good control on desmopressin. While her dosage certainly could have required adjustments postoperatively, she should have been able to maintain normal sodium levels by increasing her oral fluid intake in response to increases in plasma osmolality. Therefore, an insufficient desmopressin dosage (Answer E) is incorrect.",

When on the same prednisone dosage in the past, she developed hyperglycemia with glucose values in the range of 300 to 400 mg/dL (16.7-22.2 mmol/L) and mild-to-moderate ketonuria. She will receive her first prednisone dose tomorrow morning. She is currently on insulin pump therapy, and her most recent hemoglobin A1c value was 7.2% (55 mmol/mol).",
        "question": "What, if any, initial changes in the pump settings do you recommend to control her blood glucose while she is taking glucocorticoids?",
        "options": "A. Increase all correction/insulin sensitivity factors by 30% now; B. Increase all basal rates by 30% now; C. Increase insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios by 30% now; D. Increase all basal rates by 30% within 6 to 12 hours after initiating prednisone; E. Check blood glucose every 3 hours and correct hyperglycemia as needed without adjusting insulin pump settings.",
        "answer": "D. Increase all basal rates by 30% within 6 to 12 hours after initiating prednisone",
        "explanation": "Insulin requirements to maintain normoglycemia during glucocorticoid therapy and stress are often difficult to estimate. The total daily insulin requirement may increase 30% to 100% within 6 to 12 hours after the first prednisone dose and return to baseline amounts 24 to 48 hours after therapy. Increasing the basal insulin rate by 30% within 6 to 12 hours after initiating prednisone (Answer D) is the best initial management strategy to prevent anticipated hyperglycemia. High-dosage glucocorticoids are associated with insulin resistance and increased hepatic gluconeogenesis. These effects markedly increase insulin requirements in patients with type 1 diabetes and may even result in ketosis. The impact of glucocorticoid therapy on glycemic control is typically not seen immediately upon treatment initiation and the effects may persist for several days after discontinuing therapy. The longer the half-life of the glucocorticoid, the longer it will affect glycemic control. The effects of glucocorticoids on blood glucose values are influenced by the specific glucocorticoid chosen, the dosage, and the timing of the doses. Higher doses and more potent glucocorticoids are associated with higher insulin requirements. Because glucocorticoids increase insulin requirements due to increased gluconeogenesis, these effects persist throughout the day. Increasing the insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios by 30%, which would be used only for mealtimes (Answer C), would not provide stable glycemic control beyond the mealtimes, especially overnight. Likewise, increasing the correction/sensitivity factors (Answer A) would be helpful for controlling blood glucose after hyperglycemia occurs, but would do little to prevent the development of hyperglycemia. The reactive approach of just monitoring blood glucose values and correcting the hyperglycemia (Answer E) with the existing correction factor will not be sufficient to maintain blood glucose in the target range because of insulin resistance. Increasing basal rates within 6 to 12 hours after initiating prednisone (Answer D)—not immediately (Answer B) (which may cause hypoglycemia)—is a reasonable first step to ameliorate the anticipated deterioration of glycemic control. A 30% increase is a good place to begin, although some patients may require more aggressive increases in basal rates. If a patient continues to have significant glycemic excursions after meals, it is reasonable to also increase meal bolus insulin coverage by intensifying insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios and even the correction/ sensitivity factors. The insulin management strategy highlighted in this vignette is specific to patients who are on insulin pump therapy. If the patient were on multiple daily injections of insulin, the concept of increasing basal insulin by 30% would still be a valid approach. Yet, depending on the timing of the “basal” insulin injection, there could be a delay in increasing the basal insulin amount. The delay could potentially result in interval hyperglycemia, which could be remedied by administering frequent (every 3 hours) “correction” bolus doses of rapid-acting insulin until the adjustment in basal insulin takes effect.",

"026": {"case": "A 12-and-6/12-year-old girl is referred for evaluation of short stature. She was originally seen by an adult endocrinologist closer to home at age 8 years because of poor growth. At that time, laboratory test results (comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood cell count, thyroid function tests) and bone age were normal. On physical examination today, her height is 49 in (124.5 cm) (<1st percentile, –2.9 SD), weight is 118.8 lb (54 kg) (85th percentile), and BMI is at the 98th percentile. Her vital signs are normal. She has macrocephaly and mild retrognathia. Her arms and legs appear short. She has mild brachydactyly. She does not have scoliosis. Breasts and pubic hair are Tanner stage 5. Her mother reports that she grew 1.5 cm in the last year. Breast development and pubic hair growth started at age 9 years, and menarche was at age 11 years. She has spontaneous regular menses. She has a history of frequent ear infections. There are no developmental delays. Review of systems is otherwise normal.

        "answer": "C. Activating pathogenic variant in the FGFR3 gene",
        "explanation": "This patient has poor growth, short stature, obesity, macrocephaly, brachydactyly, and short limbs. She had normal onset and progression of puberty. These features are indicative of skeletal dysplasia. Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism, occuring in 1 in 15,000 to 25,000 individuals. Autosomal dominant gain-of-function pathogenic variants in the FGFR3 gene (Answer C), most of them sporadic but with 100% penetrance, are the most common cause of achondroplasia and related chondrodysplasia syndromes, including hypochondroplasia, severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans (SADDAN), and the lethal form thanatophoric dysplasia. Obstructive and central sleep apnea are common in individuals with achondroplasia, and a sleep study is recommended for all patients with this condition. Other common issues in individuals with achondroplasia include middle ear dysfunction, lower-extremity bowing, kyphosis, spinal stenosis, joint laxity, and arthritis. Thus, regular evaluation with otolaryngology and orthopedics is indicated for individuals with achondroplasia. Contact sports, joint hyperextension, trampoline use, diving, and hanging upside down from knees/feet should all be avoided due to risk of injury to the spinal cord at the craniocervical junction. References are available for anthropometric variables in achondroplasia such as sitting height, leg length, arm span, relative sitting height (sitting height/ height), and foot length. Short-term and long-term GH therapy in patients with achondroplasia has led to some height improvement, but a recent meta-analysis concluded that there are insufficient data on final adult height and changes in body proportion with GH therapy. C-type natriuretic peptide analogue has been proposed as a potential treatment option in clinical trials, as it antagonizes FGFR3 signaling by down-regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which is activated as a result of an FGFR3 gain-of-function pathogenic variant in affected patients. Maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 (Answer A) results in Prader-Willi syndrome, which is associated with hypotonia, hyperphagia after infancy, morbid obesity, developmental delays, and hypogonadism. However, the patient in this vignette does not have any of these features. Although patients with Turner syndrome (Answer B) are also at high risk for frequent ear infections, macrocephaly and short limbs are not characteristic of this condition. Patients with an inactivating pathogenic variant in the maternal allele of the GNAS gene (Answer D) have Albright hereditary osteodystrophy with short stature, brachydactyly, and evidence of hormone resistance such as hypocalcemia due to PTH resistance and abnormal thyroid function tests. In this patient, the normal comprehensive metabolic panel, normal thyroid function, and presence of macrocephaly and short limbs make Albright hereditary osteodystrophy less likely to be the diagnosis. Pathogenic variants in the FMR1 gene (Answer E) result in fragile X syndrome, which is associated with developmental delay, learning disabilities, mental retardation, and some characteristic dysmorphic features. FMR1 pathogenic variants are not associated with short stature and macrocephaly.",

        "answer": "D. Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome",
        "explanation": "Hypospadias is one of the most common congenital anomalies in newborn males, affecting up to 1 in 200 boys. While hypospadias has been described in more than 200 syndromes, a genetic cause is identified in only 30% of cases. When associated with other abnormalities such as cryptorchidism or micropenis, there is a higher likelihood of androgen deficiency. Heritability appears to vary with severity. Severe (proximal) hypospadias is also associated with intrauterine growth restriction, maternal hypertension, and oligohydramnios, suggesting that placental insufficiency can have a role, possibly through a decrease in the fetus’s exposure to hCG. The infant in this scenario has both environmental and genetic risk factors. Given that he also has microphallus (<2.5 cm), investigation for an underlying cause is warranted. Although he most likely has idiopathic hypospadias, of the options given, partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) (Answer D) is most consistent with his presentation. PAIS is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by ambiguous genitalia, with perineoscrotal hypospadias, microphallus, and bifid scrotum. Testes can be undescended, palpable, or anywhere in between. Affected infants usually have a normal neonatal testosterone surge, although this may be reduced in the setting of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. LH and testosterone levels are often, but not always, elevated. The ability to synthesize testosterone is intact, but there is loss of negative feedback inhibition of gonadotropins. The diagnosis is confirmed by molecular genetic testing of the androgen receptor gene (AR), which would be an appropriate next step for this infant. The frequency of detecting AR pathogenic variants ranges from 65% to 95% in individuals with complete androgen insensitivity and from 40% to 45% in those with PAIS. Individuals with 5α-reductase deficiency (Answer A) have normal testosterone production but do not undergo normal virilization due to a defect in converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. While the phenotype ranges from normal female appearance to nearly normal male appearance of external genitalia, approximately 75% of affected individuals are identified as female at birth. A testosterone-to-dihydrotestosterone ratio greater than 10 is suggestive of this disorder; however, timing of laboratory studies is critical. Hormone levels should be assessed by gas or liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to avoid cross-reactivity. This assessment should be performed between 1 week and 6 months of age. In this vignette, LH and testosterone levels are consistent with the mini-puberty of infancy, so interpretation of hormone levels without hCG-stimulation testing can be considered reliable. While this infant’s phenotype is consistent with possible 5α-reductase deficiency, the testosterone-todihydrotestosterone ratio of 3.6 makes this less likely. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency (Answer B) leads to undervirilization in 46,XY individuals due to testosterone deficiency. Undervirilization can range from a severe presentation, associated with salt-losing adrenal crises, to a mild presentation with hypospadias and microphallus. Characteristic laboratory findings include elevated pregnenolone, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, and DHEA concentrations. In this vignette, laboratory findings are not consistent with 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency. Swyer syndrome (Answer C) is one form of partial XY gonadal dysgenesis, and it can be caused by pathogenic variants in one of several genes required for sexual differentiation of the fetus. Swyer syndrome is most often due to pathogenic variants in the SRY gene. Affected individuals typically have a female external appearance, thus Swyer syndrome would be an unlikely diagnosis in this vignette. Pelvic ultrasonography would demonstrate the presence of a uterus, which helps distinguish this condition from androgen insensitivity syndrome. Individuals with pathogenic variants in the LHCGR gene (luteinizing hormone choriogonadotropin receptor) (Answer E) demonstrate a phenotype ranging from mild undervirilization to completely female external genitalia. Testes are typically inguinal or intraabdominal. While the phenotype in this vignette is consistent with an LHCGR pathogenic variant, laboratory testing would be expected to demonstrate a low testosterone level with elevated LH due to Leydig-cell hypoplasia.",

        "answer": "B. Stop atorvastatin, wait 2 weeks and then reintroduce atorvastatin and assess for symptoms",
        "explanation": "Although statins are an effective way of lowering LDL-cholesterol levels, myopathy remains an important potential adverse effect. This has been reported predominantly in adults, but it has also been described in adolescents. This is a risk factor for rhabdomyolysis when creatine kinase levels are greater than 10 times the upper normal limit. The reasons for this boy’s muscle soreness and creatine kinase elevations are unclear. However, his creatine kinase elevations are mild, which can be observed following vigorous physical activity. A practice guideline for pediatric statin treatment states, “Practitioners should be aware that recommended monitoring of creatine kinase levels is more likely to result in numerous mild to severe sporadic increases that may not be attributable to the statin. Vigorous exercise, particularly contact sports or weightlifting, may cause physiological increases, and it is important that not all increases are immediately attributed to the statin.” This boy has clear reasons for being on a statin, with a high pretreatment LDL-cholesterol level and a family history of early death due to cardiovascular disease, so continuing adequate treatment for his dyslipidemia should be part of his care plan. However, since this is the second event of myalgias, most experts would recommend stopping the statin, waiting for symptoms to resolve, and reintroducing either the same or different statin and assessing for symptoms (Answer B). Continuing atorvastatin and measuring creatine kinase in 2 days (Answer A) is incorrect. There are no guidelines for either adult or pediatric myopathies, so clinical judgment continues to be the best approach to caring for patients with this symptom. Since the statin was very effective in reducing this patient’s LDL-cholesterol level and he is in the high-risk category for cardiovascular events in the future, an attempt should be made to remain on statin therapy. This boy’s creatine kinase elevations do not currently require hospitalization (Answer D) and are not concerning enough to recommend permanent discontinuation of statin treatment (Answer C). MRI (Answer E) would not be expected to reveal any notable findings, even in the setting of a muscle reaction. Despite the mild nature of the patient’s pain and degree of creatine kinase elevation, there remains the possibility that this is an early step in the process of myocyte damage. While this boy’s liver transaminase levels were normal, statin use in adults has been associated with a 0.5% rate of elevated transaminase levels (>3 times the upper normal limit. In studies of pediatric patients, there have been similar rates of elevated transaminase levels among patients taking statins and those taking placebo, potentially because of higher rates of underlying nonalcoholic steatohepatitis among treated patients. Few nonstatin treatments have adequate safety data in children, and those that do are less effective than statins in reducing LDL-cholesterol levels. Therefore, they would not be warranted without adequate suspicion of statin-related myopathy. Nonstatin therapies include ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, PCSK9 inhibitors, and bempedoic acid. Ezetimibe lowers LDL-cholesterol levels by inhibiting cholesterol absorption and up-regulating hepatic LDL receptors. While often used as an add-on therapy to statin treatment, recent studies using it as monotherapy in children showed promising results. Bile acid sequestrants have long been known to reduce cholesterol levels. Their mechanism of action is to decrease the absorption of bile acids, which results in increased synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol leading to a decrease in hepatic cholesterol and an up-regulation of hepatic LDL receptors. They are not very well tolerated by children. PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies lower LDL cholesterol by binding PCSK9 (regulator of LDL receptors), reducing the breakdown of LDL receptors, as well as by reducing lipoprotein (a) levels. Often used when statins are not tolerated, PCSK9 inhibitors are in phase 3 clinical trials in children. Bempedoic acid lowers LDL cholesterol by inhibiting hepatic ATP citrate lyase activity, thereby reducing cholesterol synthesis in the liver and up-regulating LDL receptors. Bempedoic acid is also used in patients who do not tolerate statins. It has not been studied in children to date.",

Given this patient’s elevated thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, which was negative in the past, she most likely has Graves disease, although she did not have characteristic eye findings or a bruit. A number of cases of Graves disease have been reported following Hashimoto thyroiditis, either with or without a painful gland, with most occurrences in adults. Hashitoxicosis (Answer A) is characterized by a brief period (a few weeks or less than 3 months) of hyperthyroidism that presents early in the course of Hashimoto thyroiditis. It does not present late in the course, and it occurs without elevated thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin. Silent subacute thyroiditis (Answer B) is a possibility in this patient, but her weight loss over 5 months and elevated thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin make this an unlikely diagnosis.

The hypothalamus is more sensitive than the pituitary gland to radiation. However, the somatotrophs (the GH-secreting cells of the pituitary gland) are more sensitive to radiation than the gonadotrophs, thyrotrophs, or corticotrophs. As a result, GH deficiency is more likely to occur after irradiation of the hypothalamic-pituitary region even with a lower dose (such as ≥10 Gy single fraction total body or ≥12 Gy fractionated total body), intermediate dose (≥18 Gy and ≤30 Gy cranial radiation), or higher dose (≥30 Gy cranial radiation), while deficiencies of LH, FSH, TSH, and ACTH are less likely to occur at lower or intermediate doses, but are more likely to occur after higher doses of cranial radiation (≥30 Gy). Interestingly, intermediate doses of cranial radiation (≥18 Gy and ≤30 Gy) may induce precocious puberty as opposed to LH/FSH deficiency, possibly due to disruption of hypothalamic physiologic inhibition of pubertal onset. The child in this vignette has evidence of activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis as manifested by testicular volume consistent with Tanner stage 2 to 3, which, at an age younger than 9 years in a boy is consistent with central precocious puberty. Therefore, it is unnecessary to perform a GnRH-stimulation test (Answer A). Secondary sexual characteristics, such as pubic hair and penile enlargement, may be related to adrenarche or to endogenous testosterone of testicular origin. However, despite the degree of pubertal development, his growth velocity has remained normal (prepubertal). The lack of linear growth deceleration may be confusing, as it would not prompt the clinician to think about GH deficiency. However, in the presence of precocious puberty, growth deceleration may not be obvious. IGF-1 levels may not appear low in the face of precocious puberty and therefore are not a reliable indicator in this patient. Additionally, based on the history of 20 Gy of radiation delivered to the hypothalamic-pituitary region, the possibility of GH deficiency should be entertained. Evaluation for GH deficiency with a GH-stimulation test (Answer C) is the best next step. Brain MRI (Answer D) is not indicated in this patient, as it would not change his management. His previous tumor is not associated with central precocious puberty, and the effects of the radiation would not be seen on MRI. Testicular ultrasonography (Answer E) could be performed to look for a peripheral source for testosterone. However, with measurable gonadotropins, it is not the best option. A low-dose cosyntropin-stimulation test (Answer B) is not the best next step, as there are no clinical manifestations described in the vignette to support central adrenal insufficiency and the patient had a normal 8-AM cortisol concentration. ACTH deficiency is unlikely to occur with low or intermediate doses of cranial radiation.",

        "answer": "C. Perform a 99Tc sestamibi scan",
        "explanation": "This patient has hyperparathyroidism as evidenced by elevated serum calcium, low phosphate, and inappropriately high-normal PTH. PTH is exquisitely sensitive to calcium such that any elevation in the serum calcium concentration should result in PTH suppression. High PTH levels, even in the mid- to upper-normal range, in the setting of hypercalcemia establish the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. The next step is to determine whether she has a parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia. A sestamibi scan (Answer C) is helpful in making this distinction. Autosomal dominant inactivating pathogenic variants in the gene encoding the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) can present with hyperparathyroidism. Adolescents or adults with this condition are generally asymptomatic, but there have been associations with pancreatitis or chondrocalcinosis. The biochemical profile can be similar to primary hyperparathyroidism with elevated calcium and an inappropriately normal or slightly elevated PTH level; however, the urinary calcium-to-creatinine ratio is usually less than 0.01 and the phosphate is normal. This disorder is known as familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and parathyroidectomy is not recommended in this setting. Conversely, total parathyroidectomy is recommended for patients with homozygous inactivating pathogenic variants in CASR, as this typically presents with profound hypercalcemia, very high PTH levels, and severe bone disease, including multiple fractures and hypotonia in the neonatal period. This patient is unlikely to have familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and genetic testing (Answer A) is not the best next step. While thiazide diuretics can cause hypercalcemia due to inability to excrete calcium in the urine, the physiologic response would be to suppress PTH. In this vignette, PTH was even higher on the thiazide diuretic. Thus, stopping the thiazide diuretic and repeating laboratory tests (Answer E) is inappropriate. Hyperparathyroidism has a more profound effect on cortical bone mineral density than on trabecular bone, which may explain, in part, this patient’s normal lumbar spine bone mineral density. The one-third distal radius is primarily cortical bone, and DXA (Answer D) may be useful in assessing the degree of skeletal involvement. However, it would not be useful in determining the etiology of hyperparathyroidism. In adult patients, this may guide surgical decision-making, whereas in younger patients (<50 years) parathyroidectomy is usually indicated, even in asymptomatic patients. The most common cause of hyperparathyroidism is a benign adenoma (80%). The 2 most common techniques to localize parathyroid adenomas are parathyroid ultrasonography (Answer B) or a technetium 99Tc sestamibi scan (Answer C). Single-photon emission CT (SPECT) has also been used to localize parathyroid adenomas, but this approach is generally better for ectopic parathyroid tissue and carries the risk of radiation exposure. Parathyroid ultrasonography is technician dependent and may be more challenging in pediatric patients in whom this is a more rare condition. Technetium 99Tc sestamibi scans have a higher positive predictive value, although they may miss small adenomas and are not ideal for multiglandular disease (hyperplasia). This is because the technique relies on the preferential retention of the radiotracer in the mitochondrial-rich oxyphil cells of the hyperfunctioning gland. If all glands are functioning with a similar intensity, they will all experience similar washout and the overall result of the scan will be negative. It is important to therefore remember that a 99Tc sestamibi scan is not used to diagnose hyperparathyroidism, but rather to determine whether it is caused by a parathyroid adenoma and to guide the surgical approach.",

He was born at 37 weeks’ gestation, with a birth weight of 4 lb 8 oz (2050 g) (small for gestational age) and birth length of 17.7 in (45 cm). His clinical course in infancy was complicated by feeding difficulties and recurrent hypoglycemia, particularly with illness, requiring hospital admission. He was evaluated by a geneticist and was found to have a methylation defect involving chromosome 11p15. He started GH therapy at age 4 years, and he developed signs of pubarche at age 7 years. He had a histrelin implant placed 2 years ago, and it was removed last year. His midparental target height is 70 in (177.8 cm), and his father has a history of constitutional growth delay. His height is 62 in (157.5 cm) (25th percentile), and weight is 100.8 lb (45.8 kg) (31st percentile).

        "answer": "D. Retained portion of histrelin implant, which is continuing to suppress puberty",
        "explanation": "Silver-Russell syndrome is characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, feeding difficulties, and recurrent hypoglycemia. Individuals with Silver-Russell syndrome are at increased risk for premature adrenarche and early and rapid central puberty, which can lead to early closure of epiphyses and limited growth. The patient in this vignette presents with pubertal delay and a height velocity that has decreased over the past year despite GH treatment. Effective GH dosages for children with a history of being small for gestational age are higher than those for children with GH deficiency; thus, there may be a degree of GH resistance. However, his IGF-1 value is at the upper end of the reference range for his age, so it is unlikely that poor adherence to GH treatment (Answer A) is responsible for slowing his growth rate. In Silver-Russell syndrome, puberty typically starts at the early end of the normal range and progresses rapidly. Delayed puberty has not been reported in Silver-Russell syndrome, and, anecdotally, it was not observed by a group that studied a large cohort of patients with Silver-Russell syndrome. In one cohort, puberty began, on average, 1 year earlier in children with Silver-Russell syndrome vs children who were small for gestational age but did not have Silver-Russell syndrome. While there is a history of constitutional growth delay in this patient’s father, delayed puberty (Answer C) is highly unlikely in the setting of Silver-Russell syndrome. Gonadotropin deficiency (Answer B) is possible, but it has not been described as a feature of Silver-Russell syndrome and is an unlikely explanation for his lack of pubertal progression. Children with Silver-Russell syndrome experience acceleration of bone age advancement, most likely due to premature adrenarche and early and rapid pubertal progression, as well as other factors not yet identified. Untreated, this leads to attenuation of the pubertal growth spurt and compromised adult height. As such, bone age cannot be used to make accurate adult height predictions in children with Silver-Russell syndrome. However, bone age can be expected to correlate with timing of peak growth velocity. A height velocity of 7 to 8 cm/y would be expected with a bone age of 14 years. Thus, early epiphyseal closure (Answer E) is unlikely to be a factor in this patient’s growth pattern. Recommendations in a consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of Silver-Russell syndrome include considering treatment with a GnRH agonist for at least 2 years in children with evidence of central puberty (starting no later than 12 years in girls and 13 years in boys) to preserve adult height potential. One study reported a high rate of procedural difficulties with implant removal, citing implant fracture during removal in 16 of 58 cases (28%). Implant fracture is more likely in implants that have remained in place longer. While there are no formal guidelines for management of this situation, removing retained portions of an implant may not be practical, and the recommendation is to allow the medication to wear off over time. For the patient in this case, the continued suppression of puberty and length of time the implant remained in place suggest that the implant may have fractured on removal, with retained histrelin continuing to suppress puberty (Answer D). This may be underrecognized clinically and should be considered when puberty fails to resume with removal of a histrelin implant. Single histrelin implants have been shown to consistently suppress puberty for at least 2 years, thus the duration of action of retained fragments of implant may be significantly longer.",

        "answer": "B. MRI of the pancreas",
        "explanation": "This case illustrates a rare presentation of an insulinoma. Insulinomas are extremely rare in children, often diagnosed after a long duration of symptoms. In various case reports, affected children are often misdiagnosed as having refractory seizures, insomnia, and migraine headaches. Insulinoma recurrence is 4 times more common within 10 years in individuals who have a pathogenic variant in the MEN1 gene (associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1) than in those who do not. Hypoglycemia in infancy can be a presentation of congenital hyperinsulinism, GH deficiency, or adrenal insufficiency. Insulinoma should be considered in children presenting with nonketotic hypoglycemia beyond the age of infancy, as hypopituitarism does not usually present with isolated hypoglycemia in older children. GH and cortisol may not increase if hypoglycemia is insidious or if there are frequent episodes of hypoglycemia as observed in this case. Inappropriately high insulin and C-peptide in the presence of nonketotic hypoglycemia indicate a β-islet–cell lesion. Other causes of nonketotic hypoglycemia are carnitine deficiency or β-oxidation defects such as MCAD (medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency) presenting with low insulin levels, hepatomegaly, increased anion gap, hyperuricemia, elevated liver transaminases, and hyperammonemia. Localization of an insulinoma is challenging due to the probability of multiple, diffuse, or extrapancreatic lesions. Up to 10% of insulinomas are malignant and 6% are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Different invasive and noninvasive imaging modalities are used to localize the lesion, although the sensitivities and specificities are not documented in children. Invasive modalities include (1) arterial stimulation and venous sampling, in which different arteries supplying pancreatic tissue are infused with calcium followed by hepatic venous sampling to detect a rise in insulin; (2) transhepatic portal venous sampling; and (3) endoscopic ultrasonography. Peranteau et al reported 8 cases of insulinoma in children; one had arterial stimulation and venous sampling and another had transhepatic portal venous sampling. Both modalities accurately localized the lesion, whereas endoscopic ultrasonography localized the lesion in 2 of 5 cases. MRI is a noninvasive modality with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting insulinoma in adults. Peranteau et al reported a detection rate of 50% (3/6) while Padidela et al reported accurate localization in 88% (7/8) with MRI. Octreotide scans have poor detection rates for insulinoma, as these tumors usually do not express enough somatostatin receptors. 18F-DOPA is taken up by neuroendocrine cells and is used to distinguish between focal and diffuse lesions in congenital hyperinsulinism. The 18F-DOPA PET scan is inconsistent in localizing insulinoma in children (100% [3/3] in one series and 50% [2/4] in another). GLP-1 receptor imaging is a new noninvasive modality that has shown 100% successful localization in a small study of 6 cases. Radiolabeled peptides have shown promising results in localizing the lesions in oncology and endocrinology cases. GLP-1 binds to specific receptors on β-islet cells to induce insulin release. GLP-1 receptors are expressed on insulinomas in large quantity. In this patient, MRI of the pancreas (Answer B) detected the lesion correctly at first presentation, as well as at recurrence. An octreotide scan performed at first presentation and PET scan performed at the time of recurrence both detected the lesion correctly. Sulfonylureas are used extensively for treating type 2 diabetes. Sulfonylurea poisoning can produce sustained and profound hypoglycemia refractory to intravenous dextrose, particularly in children and elderly patients. A sulfonylurea screen (Answer A) could be considered, but there is no suggestion in the vignette that this child has access to a sulfonylurea. The history of rapid weight gain also favors chronicity of insulin secretion vs an acute elevation due to ingestion. One should also consider factitious hypoglycemia due to exogenous insulin administration. Endogenous insulin is synthesized as a precursor, proinsulin, which undergoes enzymatic cleavage to produce insulin and C-peptide in equimolar amounts. Therefore, factitious hypoglycemia produced by exogenous insulin administration leads to suppressed C-peptide levels. In addition, proinsulin levels are poorly suppressible in patients with insulinoma in contrast to those without insulinoma. In patients with surreptitious use of insulin or an oral hypoglycemic agent, the proinsulin level is either normal or decreased. Diazoxide is a benzothiazine derivative that acts as a potent β-cell KATP channel opener. The stabilization of open KATP channels leads to the inhibition of insulin secretion. Diazoxide challenge (Answer C) would not provide any diagnostic value in this case, but it could help manage hypoglycemia until surgical intervention. After a second critical sample, obtaining a third critical sample (Answer D) is not necessary. Genetic testing (Answer E) is relevant to establish the diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1 pathogenic variant). However, it is not the best next step in establishing the diagnosis of insulinoma in this case.",

There is no history of recent illness or infections. On physical examination, she has a nontender, symmetric goiter. She has no upper eyelid retraction, scleral erythema, or proptosis. Her weight is 44 lb (20 kg). Laboratory test results: TSH = 0.005 mIU/L (0.27-4.2 mIU/L); Free T4 = 2.5 ng/dL (0.9-1.7 ng/dL) (SI: 32.2 ng/dL [11.6-21.9 pmol/L]); TPO antibodies = 479.9 IU/mL (<9.0 IU/mL) (SI: 479.9 kIU/L [<9.0 kIU/L]); TSH-receptor antibodies = >40 IU/L (0-1.75 IU/L).

        "answer": "A. Discontinue methimazole and discuss thyroidectomy",
        "explanation": "Thyrotoxicosis is a clinical condition caused by increased thyroid hormone action. Hyperthyroidism is thyrotoxicosis secondary to increased synthesis of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in children is Graves disease. Graves disease is an autoimmune thyroid disease. The pathophysiology of autoimmune thyroid disease involves diffuse infiltration of T-cell lymphocytes into the thyroid gland, while B-cell lymphocytes produce different autoantibodies (most commonly against the TSH receptor (TSHR), thyroglobulin, and TPO. In Graves disease, the predominant antibodies are directed against the TSHR (TRAb), with predominant activating-type antibodies. In children and adolescents, Graves disease can be treated with methimazole, radioactive iodine therapy, or thyroidectomy. However, the use of radioactive iodine is not recommended for children younger than 5 years because of the higher risk of thyroid cancer in this population after external radiation. Medical treatment is considered first-line therapy in children and adolescents because some children go into remission. Antithyroid drugs used in the United States include methimazole and propylthiouracil. In Europe, carbimazole, a methimazole pro-drug, is also available. Antithyroid drugs peak in serum within 1 to 2 hours after ingestion and antithyroid effects last 12 to 24 hours. Their primary effect is to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis by blocking TPO. Propylthiouracil also blocks the peripheral conversion of T4 into T3, and these drugs have also been shown to have immunomodulatory effects. Methimazole is the recommended drug in children and adolescents, while propylthiouracil is contraindicated in this population because of the high risk of hepatotoxicity (liver failure in 1 in 2000 to 1 in 4000 children). Methimazole can be given once daily, as it has a longer duration than propylthiouracil, and the dosage used ranges between 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg per day, usually 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg per day. To maintain euthyroidism, the dosage is usually decreased as levels normalize. The approach of blocking with methimazole and replacing with levothyroxine is not currently recommended in the guidelines because this practice has been associated with higher dosages of methimazole and complications. Antithyroid medications have mild and severe adverse effects. Mild adverse effects include rash, arthralgias, nausea, abnormal sense of taste or smell, and, very rarely, sialadenitis. Rash can be managed by concurrent administration of antihistamine. Major complications include agranulocytosis, hepatitis, cholestasis, liver failure, ANCA-positive vasculitis, and polyarthritis. Very rarely thrombocytopenia and aplastic anemia and pancreatitis may also develop. Most adverse effects of methimazole are dosage dependent; therefore, lower dosages are recommended except in cases of severe hyperthyroidism. However, reactions can occur even at lower dosages and all patients must be warned about adverse effects. Adverse effects in children have been reported in 6% to 35%, usually in the first 3 months of treatment, although they can occur at any time. Mild granulocytopenia and mild elevation of liver enzymes can be seen in patients with Graves disease. Therefore, obtaining baseline levels before starting treatment is a good practice, as illustrated in this patient. Complete blood cell count with differential should be ordered immediately if the patient develops fever, sore throat, arthralgias, mouth sores, or malaise. Liver enzymes must be measured immediately if the patient develops abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, light-colored stools, pruritus, anorexia, or malaise. Patients and their caregivers should be educated on the adverse effects of antithyroid drugs, preferably in writing, and they should be advised to stop the medication immediately and to contact their physician if they develop any of the symptoms associated with major complications of antithyroid medications. Antithyroid medications should be discontinued if transaminase levels (in asymptomatic or symptomatic patients) are 2 to 3 times the upper normal limit. After discontinuing the drug, levels must be monitored weekly until they resolve. If there is no evidence of improvement, referral to gastroenterology is indicated. This patient’s levels are already 2 to 3 times above the upper normal limit, and they are rising. Decreasing the methimazole dosage (Answers C and E) is not recommended. Although the patient may benefit from seeing a gastroenterologist/hepatologist (Answers D and E) if liver enzymes do not improve following discontinuation of methimazole, referring her to gastroenterology before discontinuing the drug is incorrect. This patient has developed a severe reaction to methimazole and the drug must be discontinued. She needs definitive treatment for Graves disease. In view of her age, total thyroidectomy in the hands of a high-volume surgeon (Answer A) is the best course of action. Radioactive iodine (Answer B) is not recommended in children younger than 5 years. She will need supersaturated potassium iodine drops (SSKI, 50 mg iodine/drop), 1 to 2 drops 3 times daily for 10 days before surgery.",

His parents are nonconsanguineous and are of Romanian origin with no notable family history. His mother reports that her pregnancy with him was uneventful. He was born by vaginal delivery at 38 weeks’ gestation with a birth weight of 6 lb 3 oz (2800 g). Apgar scores were 9/10, and assessment of cord gases documented a pH value of 7.42. He had respiratory arrest at 15 hours of life with a documented low glucose value. Over the next 14 days, he had recurrent hypoglycemic episodes. He required phototherapy for 72 hours because of jaundice. Endocrinology consult is requested. On assessment, his weight is 7 lb 1 oz (3200 g), blood pressure is 78/42 mm Hg, and pulse rate is 140 beats/min. He appears jaundiced with no skin hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. No dysmorphic features are noted. Findings on cardiovascular and respiratory examinations are normal. He has normal male external genitalia, and both testes are palpable in the scrotum.

        "options": "A. Standard-dose cosyntropin-stimulation test; B. Low-dose cosyntropin-stimulation test; C. Brain and pituitary MRI; D. 17-Hydroxyprogesterone measurement ; E. Adrenal ultrasonography.",
        "answer": "C. Brain and pituitary MRI",
        "explanation": "Brain and pituitary MRI (Answer C) would be the most useful next test to determine the position and morphology of the pituitary gland (both anterior and posterior) and pituitary stalk, as well as presence or absence of the septum pellucidum, optic nerve appearance, midline defects, or masses. MRI of the brain and pituitary is the most sensitive method to image the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In this newborn, brain MRI was normal, thus excluding any structural or space-occupying lesions that may affect the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency is clear in view of the undetectable serum cortisol and inappropriately normal plasma ACTH concentrations during a documented hypoglycemic episode. Therefore, performing either a standard dose (Answer A) or low-dose (Answer B) cosyntropin-stimulation test is not necessary. Identification of additional pituitary hormone deficiencies (TSH, GH, gonadotropin, diabetes insipidus) is important, although this can be challenging during the neonatal period. In this vignette, the normal free T4, TSH, and GH levels during a hypoglycemic episode make deficiencies in TSH and GH unlikely now. Gonadotropin measurement would be helpful to detect mini puberty and to exclude congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The recommendation is to perform gonadotropin hormone profiling at 4 to 8 weeks of life. Prolactin levels should also be assessed, as some genetic forms of congenital hypopituitarism are associated with prolactin deficiency. Central diabetes insipidus should always be considered, especially in neonates and children with midline defects. In this child, the lack of polyuria and hypernatremia is reassuring. It is important to remember that diabetes insipidus can be masked in patients with ACTH deficiency, as cortisol is essential for water excretion, and diabetes insipidus may only present clinically following treatment with hydrocortisone. Measuring 17-hydroxyprogesterone (Answer D) and performing ultrasonography of the adrenal glands (Answer E) are unhelpful in the situation of secondary adrenal insufficiency. Secondary adrenal insufficiency can be congenital or acquired and either isolated or combined with other pituitary hormone deficiencies. Genetic workup should be performed in all patients with congenital secondary adrenal insufficiency. Recessive pathogenic variants in the TBX19 gene (formerly TPIT) are the main cause of congenital isolated ACTH deficiency. In this particular case, a homozygous frameshift mutation in exon 6 (782delA) was identified. ACTH deficiency has also been described in other congenital forms of hypopituitarism associated with pathogenic variants in the following genes: PROP1, LHX3, FGF8, LHX4, ARNT2, GLI2, PCSK1, and POMC. Both PCSK1 and POMC are associated with weight gain and hypopigmentation. With several of these conditions, such as PROP1 pathogenic variants, ACTH deficiency can evolve with time, so continuous monitoring and assessment are required. An important acquired cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency is the use and subsequent withdrawal of glucocorticoid-containing drugs. Other causes of secondary adrenal insufficiency include trauma (prenatal or postnatal), infection or inflammation (eg meningitis, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, autoimmune), infiltrative causes (eg, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, hemochromatosis), tumors (eg, craniopharyngiomas), or pituitary surgery or radiotherapy. Diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency can be challenging, especially in the first 9 months of life before the establishment of a circadian rhythm (eg, asymptomatic neonates with midline defects at risk of adrenal insufficiency). In such circumstances, multiple paired cortisol and ACTH measurements may point towards a diagnosis. A standard cosyntropin-stimulation test is safe and easy to perform. Once a circadian rhythm has been established, the combination of an 8-AM serum cortisol measurement greater than 6.3 μg/dL (>175 nmol/L) and a 30-minute serum cortisol value greater than 18.1 μg/dL (>500 nmol/L) on standard cosyntropin-stimulation testing have a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 100% in excluding ACTH deficiency. The low-dose cosyntropin-stimulation test has been proposed as a more sensitive test for diagnosing secondary adrenal insufficiency although there is no consensus and it is not performed universally. The corticotropin-releasing hormone test (corticotropin-releasing hormone 1 mcg/kg, maximum dose 100 mcg) has been suggested to distinguish hypothalamic from pituitary disease in secondary adrenal insufficiency. However, because of variable responses and undefined normal ranges, the usefulness of this test is unclear. Treatment of secondary adrenal insufficiency consists of glucocorticoid replacement. Endocrine Society guidelines suggest a starting dosage of 8 mg/m2 per day in 3 to 4 divided doses to be titrated according to individual need. The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests a dosage of 9 to 12 mg/m2 per day to compensate for incomplete intestinal absorption and hepatic metabolism. Hydrocortisone is preferred in children over other types of glucocorticoid (prednisolone and dexamethasone) to avoid adverse effects and to be able to titrate treatment more accurately. Depending on the cause and associated pituitary deficiency, additional hormone replacement may be required at varying time points in childhood. Before thyroid hormone replacement is initiated, it is important to ensure that glucocorticoid deficiency is adequately treated. Furthermore, patients with combined pituitary hormone deficiencies who start glucocorticoid replacement should be carefully monitored for development of diabetes insipidus. Like all forms of adrenal insufficiency, primary or secondary emergency management during illnesses and trauma, along with patient and family education is critical. Apart from individuals with isolated ACTH deficiency due to pathogenic variants in the TBX19 gene, other causes of secondary adrenal insufficiency are likely to require long-term surveillance and assessment of progressive involvement of other pituitary hormones.",

        "answer": "E. Heterozygous inactivating pathogenic variant in NPR2 in the patient and homozygous inactivating pathogenic variants in NPR2 in her brother",
        "explanation": "The 4-year-old girl in this vignette has mild short stature, normal bone age, and normal laboratory results. These findings would be consistent with possible diagnoses of familial short stature (as her parents are short) or idiopathic short stature. However, her family history is revealing in that there is parental consanguinity, which may increase the possibility of autosomal recessive disorders. In fact, her brother has severe disproportionate short stature with dysmorphic features consistent with acromesomelic dysplasia Maroteaux type (short stature with shortening of the distal and midsegments of the extremities, prominent forehead, wide and depressed nasal bridge, prominent lips) and normal intellect. This condition is due to homozygous inactivating pathogenic variants in the NPR2 gene, which encodes natriuretic peptide receptor B, one of the receptors for C-natriuretic peptide. C-natriuretic peptide, through its interaction with natriuretic peptide receptor B, stimulates growth plate chondrogenesis and, therefore, promotes linear growth. Homozygous inactivating pathogenic variants in NPR2 are responsible for acromesomelic dysplasia Maroteaux type, while heterozygous inactivating pathogenic variants have been described in individuals with idiopathic short stature without significant dysmorphism except for slightly short extremities, as manifested by an arm span that is slightly shorter than the height of this 4-yearold girl. Thus, Answer E is correct. Both parents have mild-to-moderate short stature and are obligate carriers of NPR2 inactivating pathogenic variants. As such, with each pregnancy, they have a 25% chance of having a child with acromesomelic dysplasia Maroteaux type (homozygous NPR2 pathogenic variants), a 50% chance of having a child with isolated short stature of mild-to-moderate degree (heterozygous NPR2 pathogenic variant), and a 25% chance of having an unaffected child (normal biallelic NPR2 gene). Activating pathogenic variants in the NPR2 gene (Answer B) would be expected to lead to an overgrowth condition. This has been indirectly demonstrated in animals overexpressing the C-natriuretic peptide gene. Inactivating FGFR3 pathogenic variants (Answer C) result in overgrowth conditions. Achondroplasia (Answer A) results from heterozygous activating pathogenic variants in the FGFR3 gene. Achondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner or arises by de novo mutation. The condition is characterized by rhizomelic (proximal [ie, humeral and femoral]) limb shortening, macrocephaly, midface hypoplasia, and trident hand configuration, which are easily recognized at birth. Achondroplasia differs from acromesomelic dysplasia Maroteaux type in which the limb segments that appear short are the mid and distal segments and the shortening is not manifested at birth but becomes evident postnatally. Pseudoachondroplasia is an unrelated disorder due to heterozygous (autosomal dominant) pathogenic variants in the COMP gene (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein), which lead to accumulation of an abnormal version of this protein in the endoplasmic reticulum that induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and death of the chondrocytes. Clinical manifestations include disproportionate short stature, deformities of the lower extremities, short fingers, laxity of ligaments, and progressive osteoarthritis. Although Turner syndrome could be a consideration in this 4-year-old girl, even in the absence of stigmata suggestive of this condition, it is unlikely that the severe short stature and multiple dysmorphic features of the 8-year-old brother are due to SHOX haploinsufficiency (Answer D), where mesomelic (midsegment) limb shortening along with Madelung deformity are more characteristic.",

        "explanation": "Bariatric procedures are increasingly used as a means of effectively inducing weight loss and avoiding complications of extreme obesity in adolescents. The American Academy of Pediatrics developed guidelines to help determine which patients are appropriate candidates for bariatric surgery. The December 2019 policy statement recommends that pediatric patients with the following findings be considered for bariatric surgery: Class 2 obesity, BMI ≥35 kg/m2 or 120% of the 95th percentile for age and sex (whichever is lower), with clinically significant comorbidities (including obstructive sleep apnea [apnea-hypopnea index >5], type 2 diabetes, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, Blount disease, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypertension) OR Class 3 obesity, BMI ≥40 kg/m2 or 140% of the 95th percentile for age and sex (whichever is lower), with or without comorbidities BMI and BMI percentile (Answer D) are considered one of the criteria to determine whether a pediatric patient should be considered for bariatric surgery. This patient’s BMI of 38 kg/m2, however, does not meet criteria for recommending bariatric surgery, as he has no qualifying comorbidities. Dyslipidemia (Answer A) is not considered to be a clinically significant comorbidity according to the guidelines. Neither family history of bariatric surgery (Answer C) nor history of participating in a formal weight-loss program (Answer E) is a consideration for bariatric surgery eligibility according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Completion of pubertal growth (Answer B) is not necessary in order to proceed with a bariatric procedure. Therefore, this patient’s age does not disqualify him from being considered for bariatric surgery. Previously, clinicians were concerned that the procedure might accelerate and limit further linear growth in adolescent patients. In fact, studies, including a prospective study by Olbers et al, have shown that patients who have the procedure continue to grow afterwards.",

        "answer": "D. Ovarian failure due to follicle depletion",
        "explanation": "This patient has hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, as indicated by elevated FSH and LH and low serum estradiol. This most often falls under the category of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). POI is defined as ovarian failure before age 40 years and has an incidence of approximately 1%. In this vignette, lack of pubertal development suggests absent ovarian function before onset of central puberty. In POI, ovarian failure is due to either ovarian follicle dysfunction or accelerated ovarian depletion, without clear etiology approximately 90% of the time. As such, ovarian follicle depletion (Answer D) is the most likely etiology of the options listed. Other causes of POI include autoimmunity, galactosemia, and fragile X premutation. An increased number of CGG triplet repeats in the FMR1 gene (Answer A) is associated with both fragile X syndrome and fragile X premutation. Normally, this DNA segment is repeated 5 to 40 times. In fragile X syndrome, the segment is repeated more than 200 times, which causes loss of the FMR1 protein. Small CGG repeat expansions in the range of 55 to 200 repeats, classified as a fragile X premutation, causes production of a dysfunctional protein. Fragile X premutations are identified in approximately 5% of patients of POI. Individuals with fragile X syndrome, however, have the same risk of POI as the general population. Excess ovarian androgen production (Answer B) can cause anovulation, but lack of pubertal development would not be expected. Individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome have an elevated LH-to-FSH ratio, but within normal range and not suggestive of POI, as in this case. This patient lacks other features associated with polycystic ovary syndrome such as hirsutism, and hyperandrogenemia would be an unlikely explanation for her examination and laboratory findings. Elevated prolactin has a number of causes, including pituitary adenoma, other hypothalamic and pituitary disorders, hypothyroidism, renal or liver failure, or autoimmune disorders. Hyperprolactinemia is a fairly common cause of amenorrhea; however, the mechanism is due to inhibition of LH pulses, so the expected hormone profile would show low levels of FSH and LH. As such, elevated prolactin levels (Answer E) would not be consistent with this case presentation. Several chromosomal abnormalities (Answer C) are associated with POI, including Turner syndrome and tetrasomy X. Short stature is a nearly universal finding in Turner syndrome. This patient is growing well along higher percentiles and has no other features consistent with Turner syndrome. While half of females with tetrasomy X develop POI, most have other identifiable features, including dysmorphic facial features, cleft palate, dental abnormalities, hypotonia, scoliosis, developmental delays, hearing and vision problems, cardiac defects, and seizures. While a karyotype would be indicated in any female patient with POI, the patient in this vignette is unlikely to have a chromosomal abnormality as an explanation for her hypogonadism.",

        "explanation": "In most cases of hyperthyroidism, total T3, total T4, and free T4 are elevated. Some patients with Graves disease, for example, present with T3 thyrotoxicosis, but free T4 would not be in the low-normal range as it is in this patient, and the discrepancy between T4 and T3 would not be as great as it is in this vignette. The clinician must determine whether this patient has subacute thyroiditis or exogenous intoxication, most likely from the diet pills. A complete blood cell count with differential (Answer A) would not help distinguish between the 2 diagnoses. Measuring calcitonin (Answer C) is not indicated. Procalcitonin measurement (Answer D) could help assess whether there is a bacterial infection (which could also explain an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate), but it would not be helpful in this case, as subacute thyroiditis is often associated with preceding viral illnesses. Thyroid ultrasonography (Answer E) may be helpful in imaging a hot nodule, but a focus of intense uptake would have been visible on the thyroid scan if that were the case. The best next step is to measure thyroglobulin (Answer B), which would be low in the setting of exogenous intoxication and normal in subacute thyroiditis. Measuring thyroglobulin antibodies would help ensure that the thyroglobulin level reported is not artificially low due to an elevated antibody titer. Specialized thyroglobulin assays (liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry) used to monitor patients with thyroid cancer can also be used in the setting of elevated thyroglobulin antibodies. This patient was indeed receiving exogenous T3 from her diet pills, which explains the very high T3 and normal free T4. She obtained the pills while on vacation in Mexico. Such pills are banned by the US FDA, but they can still be purchased outside the United States.

Calcitriol supplementation is not recommended as part of the initial management of hypocalcemia because endogenous levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D will rise substantially within 72 hours. Providing a maintenance dosage of calcitriol (Answers B and C) can prevent this rise and actually impede the treatment of hypocalcemia. In addition, normal infant formula generally has sufficient phosphorus, so additional supplementation is not necessary. It is also important to recognize that intravenous calcium gluconate will temporarily increase serum calcium levels, but the concentration will drop again within 2 to 3 hours if enteral calcium is not provided. Intravenous calcium (Answer C) can be used as an adjunct to enteral calcium when symptoms are severe or patients are not able to tolerate enteral calcium, but it should not be the sole source of calcium supplementation. In Answer A, the vitamin D supplementation only provides the recommended daily allotment (RDA) for infants. This is not sufficient to adequately replete the vitamin D stores in this patient. While breastfeeding should be supported when possible, and studies have shown that maternal high-dosage vitamin D supplementation of 5000 to 10,000 IU daily (Answer D) results in normal infant serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels without direct infant supplementation, this also would be appropriate for maintaining vitamin D levels, not increasing them to normal from a deficient state. In addition, the concentration of both calcium and phosphorus in maternal breast milk at 6 months postpartum is low. Severe vitamin D deficiency and hypocalcemia can cause significant cardiac effects, including prolonged QTc interval (present in this patient), as well as dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to ventricular dilatation. In a case series of 16 infants with vitamin D–associated dilated cardiomyopathy, 6 presented with cardiac arrest and 10 presented in heart failure. Fifty percent of patients required mechanical ventilation. Nearly 20% (3/16) of the children died. The child in this vignette has profound hypocalcemia with electrocardiographic changes, increasing his risk for dilated cardiomyopathy. These findings warrant urgent intervention with intravenous calcium and ongoing monitoring of telemetry. Enteral calcium must be introduced simultaneously with intravenous calcium to allow for sustained repletion of calcium stores. High-dosage vitamin D supplementation is necessary to allow absorption of enteral calcium. Monitoring the patient’s other electrolytes during refeeding is also reasonable. Thus, Answer E provides the best approach for treating the manifestations of severe vitamin D deficiency in this infant.",

        "answer": "C. Thyroid C-cell tumors: contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2",
        "explanation": "A “black box” warning is the strictest warning put in the labeling of a prescription drug by the US FDA when there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with the drug. First implemented in 1979, black box warnings highlight serious and sometimes life-threatening adverse drug reactions within the labeling of prescription drug products. Liraglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist. GLP-1 is a peptide hormone that increases insulin secretion and decreases glucagon secretion from the pancreas in a glucose-dependent manner. GLP-1 receptor agonists provide pharmacologic levels of GLP-1, which reduce glucose and weight by increasing glucose-dependent insulin secretion, decreasing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying, and increasing satiety. All of the GLP-1 receptor agonist agents are administered as subcutaneous injections. Liraglutide is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes. It reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Liraglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumors at clinically relevant exposures in both sexes of rats and mice. It is unknown whether liraglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma, in humans. The human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. However, liraglutide has a black box warning and is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. Physicians who prescribe liraglutide should counsel patients regarding the potential risk of medullary thyroid carcinoma and the symptoms of thyroid tumors (Answer C). Other warnings and precautions include: - Pancreatitis (Answer A): Postmarketing reports, including fatal and nonfatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. Discontinue promptly if pancreatitis is suspected. Do not restart if pancreatitis is confirmed. - Serious hypoglycemia (Answer D): When liraglutide is used with an insulin secretagogue (eg, a sulfonylurea) or insulin, consider lowering the dosage of the insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is higher in pediatric patients 10 years and older regardless of concomitant antidiabetes therapies. - Renal impairment (Answer B): Postmarketing reports, usually in association with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration that may sometimes require hemodialysis. Use caution when initiating or escalating doses of liraglutide in patients with renal impairment. - Hypersensitivity (Answer E): Postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylactic reactions and angioedema). Liraglutide should be discontinued and the patient should promptly seek medical advice. - Acute gallbladder disease: If cholelithiasis or cholecystitis is suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. Liraglutide was evaluated in a 26-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in 134 pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes aged 10 years and older. Patients were randomly assigned to liraglutide once daily or placebo once daily in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin treatment. All patients were on a metformin dosage of 1000 to 2000 mg daily before randomization. The basal insulin dose was decreased by 20% at randomization and liraglutide was titrated weekly by 0.6 mg for 2 to 3 weeks based on tolerability and an average fasting plasma glucose goal of 110 mg/dL or less (≤6.1 mmol/L). At week 26, treatment with liraglutide was superior to placebo in reducing hemoglobin A1c from baseline. The estimated treatment difference in hemoglobin A1c reduction from baseline between liraglutide and placebo was –1.06% with a 95% confidence interval of –1.65% to –0.46%.",

LH high, FSH normal, testosterone low, inhibin B undetectable.",
        "answer": "D. LH high, FSH high, testosterone normal or low, inhibin B undetectable",
        "explanation": "This boy has Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY), which occurs in approximately 1 in 600 newborn boys. It was first described in 1942 by Harry F. Klinefelter and is characterized by gynecomastia, small testes, Sertoli-cell dysfunction with absent or reduced spermatogenesis, normal to moderately reduced Leydig-cell function, and increased FSH secretion. Klinefelter syndrome is a frequent genetic cause of infertility in men. Additional findings can include delayed or incomplete puberty, decreased muscle mass, reduced body and facial hair, language delay, learning disabilities, and behavioral issues. However, the clinical features of Klinefelter syndrome vary widely. Like the patient in this vignette, individuals with Klinefelter syndrome may have evidence of normal virilization on examination because of relatively normal Leydig-cell function. However, testicular size is small due to a decline in germ cells, hyalinization of the tubules, and degeneration of Sertoli cells. Inhibin is a glycoprotein hormone made primarily by the gonads. It is a disulfide-linked dimer with a common α subunit and either a βA subunit forming inhibin A or a βB subunit forming inhibin B. Dimers of these β subunits form the activins (activin A βA- βA, activin B βB- βB, activin AB βA-βB). Inhibins and activins are members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family. Inhibin A and inhibin B suppress FSH secretion at the pituitary in a classic feedback loop and may also have paracrine effects in the gonads. Although activins share a common β subunit with inhibin, they have the opposite effect, stimulating FSH release. Inhibin B is the circulating form of inhibin in males. It is primarily produced by the Sertoli cells of the testis. In normal men, inhibin B levels are positively correlated with Sertoli-cell function and sperm number and negatively correlated with FSH levels. Inhibin A is mainly secreted by the corpus luteum and may serve as a prognostic factor for predicting the return of ovarian function in women. During pregnancy, the placenta becomes the major source for inhibin A secretion, also produced by the corpus luteum. Measurement of inhibin A has clinical value in women in early pregnancy with impending abortion or hydatiform mole. Inhibin B is secreted by antral follicles in response to FSH, and it is the major marker of follicular growth. Therefore, inhibin B levels in women may serve as a marker of ovarian function. Prepubertal boys with Klinefelter syndrome generally have normal serum levels of FSH, LH, testosterone, and inhibin B until onset of puberty. During puberty, testosterone levels increase initially but then plateau and remain in the low-normal range, while LH and FSH levels rise to hypergonadotropic levels by adulthood. Inhibin B levels simultaneously decrease. In most adults with Klinefelter syndrome, serum inhibin B levels are undetectable. Therefore, the most likely laboratory findings in this patient are represented in Answer D.",

        "answer": "E. Treat with 131I 120 mCi (4440 MBq) and perform posttreatment scan 4 to 7 days later",
        "explanation": "This patient has a high recurrence risk, as evidenced by regional extensive disease (N1b), tumor size, and extrathyroidal extension. She also has an aggressive type of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Although having the stimulated thyroglobulin level would further assist in medical decision-making, she would most likely benefit from radioactive iodine treatment since she has multifocal T3 tumor with extensive nodal disease and a high-risk variant of thyroid cancer. While her diagnostic 123I scan did not identify remnant nodal disease, some studies show that lymph node metastasis is sometimes only found on the posttreatment scan. For these reasons, reassuring the family based on 123I uptake alone (Answers A, B, and C) is not appropriate. A recent study provides guidelines for adults regarding use of whole-body scanning and thyroglobulin measurement to guide the dose of 131I to decrease recurrence risk in patients with radioactive-avid differentiated thyroid cancer. Doses of radioactive iodine less than 50 mCi (1850 MBq) (Answer D) are generally used in adults for thyroid remnant ablation, when there is a low risk for regional or distant metastatic disease. Therapeutic doses used in adults at high recurrence risk are usually 100 to 150 mCi (3700-5180 MBq) or higher. In children, radioactive iodine administration is usually determined based on empiric doses or may be based on whole-body dosimetry. As nicely reviewed in the management guidelines for children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer, for empiric dosing, there are several approaches: 1. 131I may be adjusted according to weight or body surface area, giving a fraction of the adult dose (eg, correcting for a 70-kg adult with similar extent of disease) 2. The dose may be adjusted based on body weight alone using a dose between 1.0 and 1.5 mCi/kg (37-56 MBq/kg) 3. A general rule based on age may be used, assuming that a 15-year-old child needs five-sixths of the adult activity, a 10-year-old child needs one-half of the adult activity, and a 5-year-old child may need only one-third of the adult dose for equivalent disease. However, current guidelines recommend that all activities of 131I should be calculated by experts with experience in dosing children. For children with extensive metastatic disease or diffuse lung uptake or in whom multiple doses are anticipated or who may have bone marrow disease, dosimetry is recommended. This patient would benefit from radioactive iodine treatment at a therapeutic dose to minimize the need of future exposure to radioactive iodine. An adult with similar extent of disease would receive about 150 mCi (5180 MBq). Of the options provided, 120 mCi (4440 MBq) (Answer E) is the best answer for this 15-year-old patient, which corresponds to five-sixths of the adult dose. Her stimulated thyroglobulin level was 43 ng/mL (43 μg/L) with negative antibodies. She received 120 mCi (4440 MBq) of 131I. A posttreatment scan showed mild residual activity in the thyroid bed and uptake in bilateral cervical lymph nodes with no evidence of distant metastasis. Nonstimulated thyroglobulin levels have decreased over 6 months to 0.2 ng/mL (athyreotic level <0.1 ng/mL) and antibodies have remained negative. Findings on neck ultrasonography have been negative.",

        "answer": "A. Redraw a fasting lipid panel in 3 months",
        "explanation": "This patient is considered to be at risk for cardiovascular disease due to her very elevated LDL-cholesterol level. However, guidelines recommend repeating a fasting lipid panel (Answer A) before diagnosing dyslipidemia. Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death in the United States. Beyond discontinuation of cigarette smoking, statin medications to lower LDL cholesterol have had an important role in recent improvements in cardiovascular mortality. LDL cholesterol–related atherosclerosis often has its roots in early childhood, with autopsy studies revealing strong correlations between atherosclerotic plaques and LDL-cholesterol levels, even during early childhood. Genetic conditions such as familial hypercholesterolemia are relatively common causes of high cholesterol levels, with a carrier rate of 1 in 500. Heterozygotes may have LDL-cholesterol levels up to 300 to 400 mg/dL (7.77-10.36 mmol/L), although they often have lower levels. This is the main basis for current recommendations regarding universal LDL-cholesterol screening. In most lipid panel assessments, direct measurements are made of total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, while triglycerides are estimated from direct measurement of serum glycerol levels. LDL cholesterol is calculated using the Friedewald equation (as long as triglycerides are <400 mg/dL [<4.52 mmol/L]): LDL = total cholesterol – HDL – 1/5 triglycerides Total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol are stable in the serum regardless of fasting status, while triglycerides can be greatly elevated after meal ingestion. Current guidelines that have been in place for more than 25 years are to treat children 10 years and older with medical therapy if they have an LDL-cholesterol level greater than 160 mg/dL (>4.14 mmol/L) plus a family history of early heart disease and to treat children 10 years and older if they have an LDL-cholesterol level greater than 190 mg/dL (>4.92 mmol/L) but no relevant family history or unknown family history and if 6 months of dietary and exercise treatment have not been successful. This patient is 7 years old and while her lipid levels are suspicious for familial hypercholesterolemia, she does not meet the high-risk criteria for initiating a statin (Answer D) with a low-risk family history. It should be noted that these guidelines are not based on long-term trials demonstrating efficacy in avoiding future cardiovascular disease, but instead are based on expert opinion given the strong relationships between LDL-cholesterol levels and clinically significant cardiovascular disease in adult cohorts. In this vignette, initiating the CHILD-2 diet (Answer B) without first attempting the CHILD-1 diet would be incorrect. The Cardiovascular Health Integrated Lifestyle Diet (CHILD-1 diet) is the initial step recommended by nutritionists to achieve a healthy lifestyle. The recommendations are age-based and vary for very young to older adolescents. The initial dietary recommendation is restricting saturated fat to less than 10% of daily caloric intake and reducing cholesterol consumption to less than 300 mg daily. It is also recommended to reduce consumption of sugary beverages. If a patient is unable to achieve the laboratory or BMI goals after a 3-month trial, the CHILD-2 diet is recommended. It further restricts saturated fat (<7% of total caloric intake) and cholesterol (<200 mg daily), and may introduce plant sterol and stanol esters, water-soluble psyllium fiber, or omega-3 fatty acids to reduce lipid levels. While fibrates (Answer C) have been used as cholesterol-lowering agents, their use is not indicated at this time without a repeated lipid panel and an attempt at nutritional intervention. Fish oil (Answer E) has been recommended to treat hypertriglyceridemia; however, experts recommend its use only after strict lifestyle intervention and for a triglyceride concentration greater than 500 mg/dL (>5.65 mmol/L).",

        "answer": "B. C-type natriuretic peptide analogue",
        "explanation": "Achondroplasia results from heterozygous activating pathogenic variants in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3) on chromosome 4p16.3. It can be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner or result from de novo mutation. The condition is characterized by rhizomelic (proximal [ie, humeral and femoral]) limb shortening, macrocephaly, midface hypoplasia, and trident hand configuration, which are usually easily recognized at birth. Four fibroblast growth factor receptors are known in humans. They localize on the cell surface and are involved in cellular proliferation. Natural ligands for FGFR-3 include several fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). The net effect of the interaction of these FGFs with FGFR-3, which involves activation of a tyrosine kinase in the post receptor cascade, is a decrease in chondrogenesis by limiting the duration of the proliferative phase and accelerating the terminal differentiation. A constitutively active gain-of-function pathogenic variant in FGFR3, therefore, leads to decreased growth plate chondrogenesis, as seen in achondroplasia. Acromesomelic dysplasia Maroteaux type is due to homozygous inactivating pathogenic variants in the NPR2 gene, which encodes natriuretic peptide receptor B, one of the receptors for C-natriuretic peptide (CNP). CNP, through its interaction with natriuretic peptide receptor B, stimulates growth plate chondrogenesis and, therefore, promotes linear growth. CNP has been postulated to enhance growth plate chondrogenesis in achondroplasia through a pathway that does not involve the FGFR-3 protein, which is dysfunctional in these individuals. CNP analogues (Answer B), through activation of the natriuretic peptide receptor B pathway, have been shown to counteract the constitutively activated FGFR-3 signaling. Phase 3 studies are now underway for the management of short stature associated with achondroplasia. Although recombinant human GH (Answer D) has been used for the management of short stature in achondroplasia and is approved in Japan for this indication, it induces a transient increase in growth velocity, which rapidly attenuates with prolongation of therapy. It is estimated that the net effect of GH therapy in individuals with achondroplasia is a height gain of 1.0 to 1.5 in (2.5-3.8 cm) after several years of treatment. GH action is mediated by IGF-1 in the growth plate. While in vitro studies have shown that IGF-1 prevents apoptosis through phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and MAPK and was expected to improve altered growth plate chondrogenesis in achondroplasia, the use of recombinant human IGF-1 (Answer A) in the clinical setting is not supported by the attenuated growth response seen during prolonged recombinant human GH therapy. GnRH analogues and aromatase inhibitors (Answers C and E), although not standard of care for the management of growth disorders, have been used to slow down growth plate maturation and delay epiphyseal fusion in peripubertal individuals, while enhancing growth plate chondrogenesis with recombinant human GH in peripubertal or pubertal individuals with short stature. These interventions would not be appropriate for the patient described in this vignette.",

        "answer": "A. Perform a pubertal examination",
        "explanation": "A pubertal examination (Answer A) is the most immediate course of action in view of the high documented height velocity at 4 years of age. Determining bone age (Answer B), measuring 17-hydroxyprogesterone (Answer C), and increasing the hydrocortisone dosage (Answer D) all have merit, but pubertal examination is an essential first step. Reducing the fludrocortisone dosage (Answer E) would not have any effect on her growth, so it is irrelevant in this case. Children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are predisposed to development of central precocious puberty. This is more common in those who have poor control or are diagnosed late with virilizing forms of CAH. In this case, the child was appropriately prepubertal, having been diagnosed with CAH at birth and treated since that time. Laboratory test results (sample drawn 2 hours after the morning dose of hydrocortisone): Androstenedione = 137.5 ng/dL (0-20.0 ng/dL) (SI: 4.8 nmol/L [0-0.7 nmol/L]); DHEA-S = 14.8 μg/dL (0-18.5 μg/dL) (SI: <0.4 μmol/L [0-0.5 μmol/L]); Testosterone = 17.3 ng/dL (<14.4 ng/dL) (SI: 0.6 nmol/L [<0.5 nmol/L]) 17-Hydroxyprogesterone = 10,656 ng/dL (SI: 322.9 nmol/L); Plasma renin activity = 4.5 ng/mL per h (<2.5 ng/mL per h for age 1-6 year old); Sodium = 138 mEq/L (133-146 mEq/L) (SI: 138 mmol/L [133-146 mmol/L]); Potassium = 4.0 mEq/L (3.5-5.3 mEq/L) (SI: 4.0 mmol/L [3.5-5.3 mmol/L]). The high serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione suggest poor control, either because of nonadherence or the need to intensify her current treatment. To assess her hydrocortisone dosage and interval, a 24-hour profile with 2 hourly serum measurements of cortisol, pre-dose 17-hydroxyprogesterone measurement, and androstenedione measurement was arranged. The aim of monitoring in children with CAH is first to ensure adequate treatment, but not overtreatment, with hydrocortisone to minimize long-term overexposure to glucocorticoids and to allow suppression of adrenal androgens. The recommended hydrocortisone dosage in children with CAH is 10 to 15 mg/m2 per day. Monitoring CAH treatment varies among different centers and is often dependent on availability of local services. However, published guidelines recommend that children with CAH be closely monitored in the first 3 months of life then every 3 months until 18 months old. After age 18 months, the recommendation is to monitor every 4 months. Monitoring incorporates regular clinical assessments and inquiring about history of adrenal crisis or salt-craving and symptoms of undertreatment or overtreatment. Clinical assessment includes measurement of growth velocity, weight, and blood pressure; assessment of pubertal status; assessment for evidence of virilization; and biochemical measurements to determine the adequacy of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid dosages. Traditionally, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione have been used as indicators of the adequacy of glucocorticoid treatment, although alternatives have been suggested such as 21-deoxycortisol and 11-oxysteroids. When using serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone as a guide to treatment, it is important to remember that complete suppression to the normal range is an indication of overtreatment.",

She had a moderately diffuse goiter, a fine tremor, and the following laboratory test results: TSH = <0.03 mIU/L (0.35-5.00 mIU/L); Total T4 = 14.1 μg/dL (4.5-12.5 μg/dL) (SI: 181.5 nmol/L [57.9-160.9 nmol/L]); Total T3 = 345 ng/dL (84-179 ng/dL) (SI: 5.3 nmol/L [1.3-2.38 nmol/L]); Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin = 480% (<140%). At diagnosis, her weight was 72.2 lb (32.8 kg). Methimazole, 7.5 mg twice daily, and propranolol were prescribed. Propranolol was stopped less than 3 weeks later because her pulse rate was 96 beats/min. Six weeks after starting methimazole, the patient comes for a follow-up visit. On physical examination today, her pulse rate is 84 beats/min. Goiter is unchanged and there is no tremor.

        "answer": "A. Wait for the result of the T3 measurement before adjusting the methimazole dosage",
        "explanation": "This patient’s thyroid laboratory results are quite typical of what is observed after methimazole therapy is initiated. Repeating the measurement of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (Answer D) so soon after diagnosis is unlikely to demonstrate a drop and will not help guide methimazole dosing. Assessing T3 uptake (Answer B) would help evaluate free T4, but it is not indicated because her total T4 concentration decreased almost 50% since starting methimazole. While her T4 level is already normal, one must verify that the T3 has normalized before reducing the methimazole dosage (thus, Answer A is correct and Answer C is incorrect). The methimazole dosage would most likely be reduced to 10 mg once daily. If the patient is already hypothyroid, the methimazole dosage could be reduced by 50%. As noted in the American Thyroid Association 2016 guidelines: “Serum T3 should be monitored because the serum free T4 levels may normalize despite persistent elevation of serum total T3. Serum TSH may remain suppressed for several months after starting therapy, and it is therefore not a good parameter for monitoring therapy early in the course.” Because TSH stays suppressed early in the course, increasing the methimazole dosage now (Answer E) is incorrect. Methimazole is a thionamide that acts as an inhibitor of the TPO enzyme, and this decreases thyroid hormone synthesis. Higher doses may increase adverse effects and also cause her to become hypothyroid.",

Recommend avoidance of contact sports and suggest golf for weight-bearing exercise instead of running.",
        "answer": "A. Refer to sports medicine for evaluation of running mechanics",
        "explanation": "In this case, recognizing and addressing the misinformation provided to the family is very important. In pediatric patients, the definition of osteoporosis is based on the presence of low-trauma vertebral compression fractures (regardless of bone mineral density) or a bone mineral density Z-score less than –2.0 and 2 pathologic long bone fractures before the age of 10 years or 3 pathologic long bone fractures before the age of 19 years. There are no criteria for osteopenia. This patient’s bone density is within normal limits. Stress fractures are also not considered to reflect pathologic bone disease. Rather, they are secondary to excessive mechanical load on normal bone. While total body and hip DXA scans (Answer B) would give additional information and are reliable sites for children in this age group, this information would not aid in the diagnosis or treatment of this patient. In addition, DXA scans are not recommended for stress fractures alone. This patient’s vitamin D level is mildly low, but his alkaline phosphatase concentration is actually normal for a young man in the midst of a pubertal growth spurt. Therefore, he is unlikely to have osteomalacia. Large meta-analyses have failed to show that raising vitamin D levels from the insufficient to sufficient range (Answer C) has a significant impact on bone density or fracture risk. In adults, significant risk factors for fracture (previous fracture, cigarette smoking history, alcohol use, family history, secondary osteoporosis) in combination with bone mineral density can be used to calculate the 10-year probability of fracture (Fracture Risk Assessment Tool or FRAX) to guide the clinician in the initiation of prophylactic bisphosphonate therapy. This tool has not been validated in pediatric patients, and there are no studies showing efficacy of oral bisphosphonates in preventing fractures in otherwise healthy children with low bone density. Thus, starting prophylactic oral bisphosphonate therapy (Answer D) would be incorrect in this patient who has a normal bone density. Although high-contact sports such as football, soccer, and lacrosse may increase risk for traumatic fractures, stress fractures occur from repetitive overuse. In patients with normal bone density, there is no reason to restrict physical activity (Answer E). Weight-bearing activity is important for bone mass accrual during childhood and maintaining bone density throughout adulthood. Running provides this mechanical stimulation; however, an evaluation by sports medicine (Answer A) may be helpful to identify gait abnormalities or areas of muscle weakness that are causing excessive mechanical strain on the bones leading to stress fracture. In addition, sports medicine physicians work closely with physical therapists and athletic trainers to help a young athlete safely return to sport. Of all the options, this is most likely to be beneficial in preventing further injuries both now and potentially during young adulthood as a military recruit. On the basis of his age and examination findings, this young man most likely started puberty at the late end of normal or possibly after age 14 years. That being said, his current Tanner staging indicates that he is progressing through puberty. There is a known increase in fracture risk around the time of the pubertal growth spurt, possibly due to the lag in mineralization and the need for recorticalization that occurs as long bones are undergoing rapid elongation at the growth plate. While there are not recommendations to adjust bone mineral density Z-scores for pubertal status, it is important to recognize that most 16-year-old boys have completed their linear growth and thus are further into the process of peak bone mass accrual that occurs in the 6 to 12 months after peak linear growth velocity. Therefore, the family could be further reassured that bone density is most likely to continue to increase and fracture risk will continue to decrease over the next year as his linear growth velocity declines.",

        "answer": "E. Offer reassurance and follow-up in 6 months",
        "explanation": "Pubertal gynecomastia is common (present in approximately 50% of boys) and is most often physiologic. Gynecomastia is generally caused by an imbalance between estrogen and androgen effects on glandular breast tissue. Estrogen levels rise more rapidly than testosterone levels during early puberty, which leads to a transiently elevated estrogen-to-androgen ratio. The patient in this scenario has evidence of puberty onset on examination without other findings suggestive of a pathologic cause for gynecomastia. Thus, reassurance and observation (Answer E) would be most appropriate at this point. Karyotype analysis (Answer A) should be ordered if there is suspicion for Klinefelter syndrome in a pubertal or postpubertal boy (eg, tall stature, small testes, and/or other features). Gynecomastia is among the more common findings in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome and is caused by elevated LH, which stimulates estradiol secretion from Leydig cells out of proportion to testosterone production. While the patient in this vignette does have excessively tall stature for family background, the normal LH concentration and stage 2 testicular development are not consistent with Klinefelter syndrome and karyotype analysis would most likely not be helpful. Assessing serum tumor markers (Answer B) would be appropriate if testicular tumors were suspected. Sertolicell tumors are rare but often present in boys younger than 13 years. In Sertoli-cell tumors, overexpression of p450 aromatase (CYP19A1) causes an increase in conversion of androstenedione to estrone, which is sufficient to advance skeletal maturation, accelerate linear growth, and cause gynecomastia. Ectopic β-hCG production from certain tumors (large cell lung carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma) acts via the Leydigcell LH receptor to stimulate testicular production of estrogen out of proportion to testosterone, which causes gynecomastia. The patient in this vignette does not have a testicular mass or other concerning findings that would warrant screening for an hCG-secreting tumor. Boys can experience significant distress due to gynecomastia and are often referred to endocrinology for consideration of treatment. When identified, treatment of an underlying disorder or elimination of a medication or environmental exposure suspected of causing gynecomastia can lead to resolution. In the rare case of aromatase excess, which includes aromatase excess syndrome, Carney complex, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, aromatase inhibitors (Answer C) have been shown to be beneficial. However, the only randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of an aromatase inhibitor for pubertal gynecomastia showed no benefit of anastrozole over placebo. It has recently been reported that pubertal boys with gynecomastia have a significantly higher estradiol-totestosterone ratio compared with that of healthy boys with either pseudogynecomastia or no breast enlargement. While it is not currently possible to prospectively determine which individuals have a transient, reversible elevation in the estradiol-to-testosterone ratio, it is known that pubertal gynecomastia that persists beyond 3 years is unlikely to regress. In this situation, surgery may be a reasonable option, particularly if there is pain or a significant degree of distress or embarrassment associated with the gynecomastia. Given that up to 90% of adolescents with gynecomastia experience spontaneous regression of breast tissue over a 1- to 3-year period, it would be premature to recommend surgery (Answer D) in a younger patient.",

        "answer": "D. Pathogenic variant in the MC4R gene",
        "explanation": "Genetic testing should be considered in pediatric patients who exhibit early-onset, severe, rapid weight gain, particularly if other features such as hyperphagia or clinical findings that could indicate a genetic syndrome are evident. Monogenic obesity results from pathogenic variants in a single gene. Leptin deficiency, leptin receptor pathogenic variants, proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency, and melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R gene) pathogenic variants are all examples of monogenic obesity conditions. Most monogenic causes are located along the leptin-melanocortin pathway, which is critical for appetite and weight regulation. Significant hyperphagia is a hallmark of monogenic conditions. Of these, an MC4R pathogenic variant (Answer D) represents the most common cause of genetic early-onset obesity and is the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this vignette. The prevalence of MC4R pathogenic variants varies between 0.5% and 6%, depending on the population studied. In most cases, it is an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. Children with an MC4R pathogenic variant have hyperphagia that is evident early in life. Additionally, they have linear growth acceleration and are tall for age, but they do not demonstrate dysmorphic features and do not have intellectual impairment. The other monogenic obesity syndromes listed below all have distinct phenotypic features that the patient in this vignette does not demonstrate. Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a rare syndromic form of obesity characterized by retinal degeneration, early-onset obesity, polydactyly, learning problems, kidney abnormalities, and hypogonadism. There are at least 19 different genes associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, but pathogenic variants in BBS1 (Answer A) account for about 25% of all cases. These variants lead to defective structure and function of cilia. Leptin deficiency is an extremely rare cause of monogenic obesity with fewer than 100 cases reported worldwide. It is due to pathogenic variants in the LEP gene (Answer B) and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Children with congenital leptin deficiency have early-onset obesity and hyperphagia and may be predisposed to increased risk of serious bacterial infections and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The most common cause of syndromic obesity is Prader-Willi syndrome, with a prevalence of 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 25,000 births. Prader-Willi syndrome is an imprinting disorder. Up to 70% of cases are due to deletions in the paternal copy of the Prader-Willi critical region, which is located on chromosome 15q11.2-q13 (Answer C). Features of Prader-Willi syndrome may include severe hypotonia in infancy, dysmorphic features, intellectual impairment, behavioral challenges, endocrine dysfunction, and nutritional phases that range from poor feeding in infancy to hyperphagia and food-seeking in childhood. Alstrom syndrome is a rare cause of syndromic obesity that, in addition to early-onset obesity, is characterized by progressive loss of vision and hearing, short stature, cardiomyopathy, early-onset type 2 diabetes, and endocrine dysfunction. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the ALMS1 gene (Answer E). Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency is another very rare cause of severe, early-onset obesity in childhood. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by loss-of-function pathogenic variants in the POMC gene. In addition to obesity and hyperphagia, affected patients tend to have fair skin and red hair. Patients with POMC deficiency are also at risk for secondary adrenal insufficiency, which requires glucocorticoid treatment to avoid potential adrenal crisis.",

        "explanation": "This newborn has lobar holoprosencephaly and cleft lip and palate. Had this mother received prenatal care, these findings would most likely have been noted on fetal ultrasonography. Holoprosencephaly is a congenital brain malformation that results from failure of the forebrain to bifurcate into 2 hemispheres, with alobar holoprosencephaly being the most severe form. Due to the midline malformation, children with holoprosencephaly commonly have endocrinopathies from variable abnormalities of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. The most common endocrinopathy is diabetes insipidus. In a study of 117 children with classic holoprosencephaly, 70% had diabetes insipidus. The severity of diabetes insipidus has been correlated with the severity of the holoprosencephaly, and it is believed to be due to abnormal development of the hypothalamus. Diabetes insipidus in this setting can present with severe hypernatremia and dehydration, but it may also evolve slowly and can be relatively asymptomatic, with hypernatremia (Answer B) found incidentally on routine screening. Appropriate fluid management with or without desmopressin is an effective treatment. In some cases, there may be abnormal hypothalamic osmoreception with rare reports of both diabetes insipidus and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis causing hyponatremia (Answer E) in the same patient. While anterior pituitary dysfunction can occur, it is less common. In the same series, hypothyroidism (Answer A) was observed in 11% of patients. Hypocortisolism, which could contribute to hypoglycemia (Answer D) occurred in 7% and GH deficiency was observed in 5%. A low IGF-1 level (Answer C) would be expected in the setting of GH deficiency.

        "answer": "E. Inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1",
        "explanation": "The action of corticosteroids in peripheral tissues is regulated, in part, by a “shuttle” mechanism of interconversion of the active hormone (cortisol = formerly known as compound F) and the inactive hormone (cortisone = formerly known as compound E), catalyzed by the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) isoenzymes. The enzyme 11β-HSD1 activates cortisone to cortisol in the liver and adipose tissue, while 11β-HSD2 inactivates cortisol to cortisone in the kidney. There is evidence that GH indirectly, through IGF-1, modulates cortisol metabolism by decreasing 11β-HSD1 activity. This leads to a decrease in the cortisol-to-cortisone ratio, which, in individuals with limited cortisol production such as patients with hypopituitarism and partial ACTH deficiency, can lead to adrenal insufficiency once GH is administered. The patient in this vignette was diagnosed with GH deficiency via an arginine-L-dopa stimulation test, which does not evaluate the integrity of the ACTH-cortisol (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis as do tests that include insulin or glucagon as one of the stimuli. It is conceivable that, in addition to GH deficiency, this child has partial ACTH deficiency that has not rendered major clinical manifestations. Initiation of GH therapy leads to reduction of an already limited cortisol reserve, triggering clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. Therefore, the mechanism that best explains this patient’s presentation is pre-existing, unrecognized ACTH deficiency with exacerbation of cortisol deficiency by GH-induced inhibition of 11β-HSD1 (Answer E) (not stimulation of 11β-HSD1 [Answer D]). Modulation of 11β-HSD2 activity could potentially lead to a similar scenario via an increase in the activity of this enzyme (Answer B). However, GH does not decrease the free cortisol-to-free cortisone ratio in the urine, suggesting that it does not affect renal 11β-HSD2 activity. A decrease in this isoenzyme activity (Answer C) would lead to enhanced activation of cortisone to cortisol and an adrenal crisis would not be expected. Inhibition of 21-hydroxylase (Answer A) could lead to a drop in cortisol levels and manifestations of an adrenal crisis in individuals with limited endogenous cortisol production such as those with partial ACTH deficiency. However, GH is not known to affect 21-hydroxylase activity.",

        "answer": "C. DXA scan",
        "explanation": "Adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus have a significantly increased fracture risk compared with the risk in the general population. Recent studies confirm that children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes also have a higher fracture risk. Multiple studies have demonstrated that children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes have lower bone mineral density than individuals without diabetes and that this correlates with future fracture risk. The bone mass deficit in type 1 diabetes may be present at an early stage after diagnosis. Suboptimally controlled celiac disease is an additional independent risk factor for low bone density. Therefore, fracture risk should contribute to the decision to order a DXA scan (Answer C) to evaluate this patient’s bone health. The existence of a low bone-turnover state, characterized by low circulating levels of both bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (Answer A), is important to highlight in children with type 1 diabetes, even with optimal glycemic control. This biochemical picture has also been described in young adults with type 1 diabetes. However, studies on bone turnover status of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes have produced variable results. These markers vary widely in growing children, and the values for bonespecific alkaline phosphatase and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen require adjustment for age and sex. The low bone turnover state might be a reflection of functional GH resistance that may exist in persons with diabetes, but circulating IGF-1 was not particularly low in the studies. There may be an inverse association between bone formation and hyperglycemia and between bone resorption and the age at diabetes diagnosis. The mechanisms that influence bone turnover in type 1 diabetes are possibly mediated through several pathways. Calcium and vitamin D levels are also usually normal, if not better, in children with type 1 diabetes compared with levels in agematched controls. Thus, measurement of IGF-1, calcium, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (Answer B) is incorrect. Skeletal survey (Answer D) may help to evaluate previously healed or healing fractures and fibrous dysplasia. However, this vignette does not suggest any history of fractures or musculoskeletal symptoms and skeletal survey is therefore not the correct choice. Recommending no further investigation unless the patient has a second fracture (Answer E) is not a valid strategy because it would delay identifying and managing underlying osteopenia.",

Her physician would like to stop prednisolone therapy and is seeking an opinion.",
        "question": "Which of the following is the best course of action?",
        "options": "A. Stop treatment now; B. Measure 8-AM cortisol; C. Change to alternate day treatment, then stop in 2 weeks; D. Wean treatment and measure 8-AM serum cortisol; E. Wean treatment and perform a standard cosyntropin-stimulation test.",
        "answer": "D. Wean treatment and measure 8-AM serum cortisol",
        "explanation": "This child most likely has adrenal suppression due to the long history of steroid use. Therefore, stopping treatment (Answer A) is incorrect. Measuring cortisol while being on prednisolone (Answer B) is not helpful, as it will not be detected. There is no clear evidence that alternate-day dosing (Answer C) prevents adrenal suppression. Weaning treatment and measuring serum cortisol (Answer D) is easy and may obviate the need for a standard cosyntropin-stimulation test (Answer E). Glucocorticoid treatment is the mainstay of treatment for many inflammatory diseases in childhood. Prolonged courses of high-dosage steroids taken orally, transdermally, or inhaled could all result in secondary adrenal suppression. Therefore, clinicians should be cautious and screen at-risk patients for adrenal suppression. When treating inflammatory bowel diseases, a 10-week course of systemic glucocorticoids is frequently prescribed to induce remission, and this treatment can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis for up to 1 year. The rates of adrenal insufficiency have been reported to be between 20% and 89% in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In adults, adrenal suppression has been reported with hydrocortisone dosages of 15 mg/m2 per day and prednisolone dosages greater than 7.5 mg daily taken for 3 weeks or longer. In children, treatment courses as brief as 2 weeks may result in transient suppression of endogenous cortisol production. Four weeks of glucocorticoid therapy suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis for up to 8 weeks after discontinuation. Central adrenal insufficiency is associated with low blood cortisol and ACTH levels. According to a review by Shulman et al and the Lawson Wilkins Drug and Therapeutics Committee, an 8-AM cortisol concentration of 3 μg/dL (82.8 nmol/L) is suggestive of the diagnosis; a value of 18 μg/dL (496.6 nmol/L) essentially eliminates it. Cutoff values are often debated and may be unit and assay dependent. Woods et al point out the utility of using a single morning cortisol measurement as the first screening step for adrenal suppression in patients with asthma to reduce the need for dynamic testing. Alternative screening methods are also possible, with a standard or low-dose cosyntropin-stimulation test being the most popular. The timing of testing is important, and different centers have adopted various time points ranging from the final phase of treatment (1 to 5 mg prednisolone daily) to months after the course is completed. Weaning regimens are different depending on the units used. The length of time off glucocorticoids before a blood test is performed is also important and is dependent on the half-life of the glucocorticoid in question.",

        "answer": "C. Fetal karyotyping by amniocentesis",
        "explanation": "Prenatal screening that is universally available to screen for multiple genetic or chromosomal disorders can also detect fetuses with Turner syndrome. Such screens include prenatal ultrasonography, which may detect increased nuchal translucency, cystic hygroma, congenital heart defects such as coarctation of the aorta and/or left sided cardiac defects, brachycephaly, renal anomalies, polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios, and growth retardation. Increased nuchal translucency seen in first-trimester ultrasonography and left-sided heart defects are common in fetuses with Turner syndrome or autosomal trisomy syndromes. However, prenatal ultrasonography and triple or quadruple marker first-trimester screening can be normal in such cases, so normal results from these assessments cannot be used to reassure patients (Answer A) when results from cell-free DNA screening are abnormal. Noninvasive prenatal screening using cell-free DNA extracted from maternal blood is increasingly used to screen for many genetic disorders. It performs well in detecting trisomy 21, 18, and 13 and can also detect sex chromosome aneuploidy. However, currently available cell-free DNA screening has a very low positive predictive value (23%) for Turner syndrome and thus positive results should be confirmed with diagnostic testing prenatally or postnatally. Fetal karyotyping by chorionic villus sampling (10-13 weeks’ gestation) (Answer D) or amniocentesis (15-18 weeks’ gestation) (Answer C) should be offered to confirm the diagnosis before making irreversible decisions (Answer E) relative to the pregnancy outcome. Repeating the cell-free DNA screen (Answer B) will not determine the diagnosis or help with guiding the next management step. Given the gestational age in this case, amniocentesis is the most appropriate diagnostic test to recommend. Amniocentesis is associated with a low risk of complications such as leakage of amniotic fluid, infection, needle injury to the fetus, and miscarriage. It is important to note that the patient may choose not to undergo any further testing, but rather to continue the pregnancy to term and consider further testing postnatally. Turner syndrome is a common chromosomal disorder with varying genotypes and phenotypes. It is characterized by complete or partial absence of the second sex chromosome with or without mosaicism in phenotypic females. Common genotypes leading to Turner syndrome include monosomy 45,X (45%-50% of all patients with Turner syndrome); varying degrees of 45,X/46,XX mosaicism (15%-25%); 45,X/46,XY mixed gonadal dysgenesis with a female phenotype (10%-12%); 46,Xi(Xq) or 46,X,idic(Xp) isochromosome Xq or isodicentric Xp (10%); and 45,X/47,XXX or 45,X/46,XX/47,XXX mosaicism with triple X (3%). Patients with small microdeletions of Xp22.3, Xq24 deletion or isodicentric Xq24, or 45,X/46,XY gonadal dysgenesis with a male phenotype are not diagnosed with Turner syndrome.",

        "answer": "C. Free T4 normal, total T3 low, reverse T3 high, high-output heart failure",
        "explanation": "The infant in this vignette has the classic presentation of consumptive hypothyroidism due to excess iodothyronine deiodinase type 3 enzyme activity, associated with large liver hemangiomas, which express this enzyme. This condition typically manifests in early infancy in babies who harbor a large tumor with high enzyme activity, either with a few large hemangiomas or multiple smaller hemangiomas that overcome the thyroid gland’s ability to compensate. TSH levels can range from mildly elevated to concentrations greater than 500 mIU/L. The mechanism was first elucidated in 2000, only after the index patient had died and his hemangioma tissue was analyzed. Type 3 deiodinase is normally present in the brain and placenta, and it catalyzes the conversion of T4 to reverse T3 and the conversion of T3 to 3,3'-diiodothyronine, both of which are biologically inactive. Heart failure in such cases is high-output failure due to decreased peripheral vascular resistance that occurs because of large arteriovenous shunts in the hemangiomas. Affected patients may also have consumptive coagulopathy depending on the size of the hemangiomas. As noted in the initial report, cardiac impairment from hypothyroidism can exacerbate the congestive heart failure associated with high-flow hemangiomas. Therefore, due to the deiodinase activity, such patients have elevated reverse T3 and low or low-normal T4 and T3, depending on the severity of the hypothyroidism. Thus, the most representative option is Answer C. Answers B and E list low reverse T3. Answer D lists high total T3 and low-output heart failure. Answer A would be correct as far as the thyroid hormone profile is concerned; however, it lists low-output heart failure. Due to the inactivation of the thyroid hormones T4 and T3, such patients require higher levothyroxine dosages than would normally be required to treat congenital or acquired hypothyroidism (sometimes given twice daily, and sometimes adding liothyronine) and thus the name consumptive hypothyroidism.",

        "answer": "A. Increased leptin, increased insulin, suppressed ghrelin",
        "explanation": "Hypothalamic obesity is a frequent complication following craniopharyngioma treatment, occurring in up to 50% of patients. In addition to craniopharyngiomas, central nervous system trauma, cranial irradiation, certain genetic conditions, and suprasellar tumors are other etiologies that can lead to hypothalamic damage and dysfunction. The hypothalamus has a critical role in energy homeostasis. Children who develop hypothalamic obesity are usually hyperphagic with impaired satiety. Even if attempts are made at caloric restriction, they demonstrate significant weight gain in the first year after treatment, followed by maintenance of a higher body weight, which is most likely due to alterations in feeding regulation and low energy expenditure. There is altered neural regulation of pancreatic β cells, which leads to increased insulin secretion. This chronic hyperinsulinemia causes increased production of leptin and suppression of ghrelin (Answer A). Leptin levels positively correlate with amount of body fat; thus, individuals with excess adiposity, regardless of cause, have higher leptin levels than do lean individuals. However, when corrected for BMI, leptin levels remain higher in patients with hypothalamic obesity than in those with simple obesity, indicating more severe leptin resistance in these patients. Congenital leptin deficiency causes very severe early-life obesity characterized by hyperphagia. These patients also have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and exhibit insulin resistance, not insulin sensitivity. Hyperinsulinemia is the presence of elevated circulating levels of insulin in the blood. Insulin resistance refers to the diminished capacity of cells to respond to circulating insulin. Hyperinsulinemia is commonly seen in the setting of insulin resistance since the pancreas has to produce more insulin in order to maintain glucose homeostasis; however, this is not always the case. Hypersecretion of insulin has been demonstrated in hypothalamic obesity, but many affected patients have normal fasting insulin levels and have been shown to be insulin sensitive, rather than insulin resistant. There is a subset of patients who, in addition to their hypothalamic obesity, also have features of metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome have hyperleptinemia similar to what is observed in patients with hypothalamic obesity. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome show heightened insulin sensitivity compared with what is observed in other obesity conditions. Unlike hypothalamic obesity, however, patients with Prader-Willi have significantly increased ghrelin levels, both fasting and postprandial.",

        "explanation": "This patient most likely has familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia secondary to a heterozygous inactivating pathogenic variant in CASR (Answer B). This autosomal dominant condition most often presents with asymptomatic hypercalcemia and an inappropriately elevated or normal PTH, but low urinary calcium excretion. However, it can also present with symptomatic hypercalcemia in the neonatal period, most often when inherited from the father, and is termed neonatal hyperparathyroidism. It is hypothesized that in utero, the fetus’s calciumsensing receptors at the parathyroid glands sense relative hypocalcemia (maternal calcium is actively transported across the placenta) and increase PTH secretion. Medical intervention with hyperhydration, bisphosphonates, and/or cinacalcet is the preferred treatment during infancy, with patients becoming asymptomatic as they grow older despite a higher serum calcium concentration (altered set point). Despite hypercalcemia, affected individuals do not develop nephrocalcinosis because the calcium-sensing receptor present in the thick ascending loop of Henle functions independently of PTH to resorb calcium and maintain the higher serum concentrations. As magnesium is also reabsorbed at the renal tubule through the action of the calcium-sensing receptor, hypermagnesemia is another common finding. Infants with homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in CASR can present with severe neonatal hyperparathyroidism with calcium levels as high as 30 mg/dL (7.5 mmol/L). Severe bone disease manifesting as rickets and multiple fractures can also be present. Generally, these patients require total parathyroidectomy, but often surgical intervention can be delayed with the above medical management. The management of postsurgical hypoparathyroidism is slightly different for these patients, as serum calcium levels can be maintained in the normal range given the low concern for nephrocalcinosis. Activating pathogenic variants in PTH1R (Answer A) result in hypercalcemia with low PTH and hypercalciuria and also have skeletal manifestations of short-limbed dwarfism (metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, Jansen type). Ninety percent of patients with inactivating pathogenic variants in MEN1 (Answer C) develop hyperparathyroidism, but this is secondary to parathyroid adenomas and generally does not present until the second or third decade of life. Inactivating variants in CYP24A1 (Answer D) and deletion of the ELN gene on chromosome 7 (Answer E) result in hypercalcemia with suppressed PTH. Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7, including the region where the elastin gene (ELN) is located, is the cause of Williams syndrome. Additionally, patients with Williams syndrome often have distinctive facial features (broad forehead, short nose with broad tip, wide mouth with full lips) and supravalvular aortic stenosis. Inactivation of 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) results in elevated levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Affected patients can develop nephrocalcinosis.",

        "answer": "C. Start oral methimazole",
        "explanation": "This adolescent with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) has hyperthyroidism due to Graves disease based on his elevated thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin. Children with Down syndrome are at increased risk for autoimmune conditions, primarily thyroiditis. Hashimoto thyroiditis is more common than Graves disease in this population. In children without Down syndrome, Graves disease is more common in females, but this is not the case in patients with Down syndrome. Pediatric patients with Down syndrome tend to develop Graves disease at a younger age than do children in the general pediatric population. While thyroidectomy (Answer A) and radioactive iodine (Answer E) are definitive therapies for Graves disease and are valid choices, they are not the best next step in this setting. The American Thyroid Association guidelines indicate that children with Graves disease may be treated with methimazole, radioactive iodine, or thyroidectomy. In choosing the initial treatment, age, clinical status, and likelihood of remission should be considered. Because some patients will go into remission, methimazole (Answer C) is still considered first-line treatment for most children. Since this child has no goiter and has mild hyperthyroidism, he would most likely benefit from methimazole, as recommended for most children with Graves disease. This child has no tachycardia, no complaints of palpitations, and no hypertension, so propranolol (Answer B) is not indicated. When a β-adrenergic blocker is needed, it should be used in addition to methimazole. This patient is symptomatic and losing weight, and Graves disease is unlikely to resolve spontaneously. Therefore, observing him and repeating thyroid function tests (Answer D) is incorrect. Although children and adolescents with Down syndrome are at higher risk of developing acute leukemia (in adolescents it would be lymphoblastic leukemia) than children in the general population, there is no increased risk of leukemia described in patients with Down syndrome on methimazole. Higher doses of radioactive iodine, as used to treat well-differentiated thyroid cancer (>100 mCi in adults), have been associated with an increased risk of leukemia, but no such risk has been observed with the 131I doses used for Graves disease. Radioactive iodine use has been reported in children with Down syndrome and Graves disease (in those older than 5 years just like in the general population, due to possible/theoretical risk of cancer in children younger than 5 years). As with surgery, 131I is not considered first-line therapy, but it is a valid option. Older children and adolescents with Down syndrome may have lymphopenia (both B and T cells), but they are not at higher risk for agranulocytosis due to methimazole than are patients with Graves disease who do not have Down syndrome. Therefore, as in other children and adolescents with Graves disease, methimazole is usually first-line therapy. One could prescribe a β-adrenergic blocker such as propranolol, or atenolol (in case of asthma) if the patient develops palpitations before methimazole is effectively controlling the hyperthyroidism, which usually takes 1 to 2 months. One publication (De Luca et al) suggests that children with Down syndrome are more likely to go into remission than children without Down syndrome, but another smaller series (Goday-Arno et al) does not support that finding. Because this patient has mild hyperthyroidism, a modest methimazole dosage may be started in the range of 5 to 10 mg twice daily (or given as 10-20 mg once daily, as used in adults), which would reduce the likelihood of adverse effects. Once his hyperthyroidism is controlled, the methimazole dosage can be decreased and administered once daily to achieve better adherence.",

        "answer": "C. Baseline 17-hydroxyprogesterone measurement",
        "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis in this child is premature adrenarche, which is diagnosed by clinical evaluation and exclusion of alternative adrenal pathologies. Premature adrenarche is due to the premature activation of the zona reticularis of the adrenal gland, which results in increased adrenal androgens, most notably DHEA and DHEA-S. One of the main differential diagnoses is nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia. A baseline 17-hydroxyprogesterone value less than 200 ng/dL (<6.1 nmol/L) is reported to have 100% sensitivity to exclude nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Cutoff values may vary depending on differences in hormonal assays used at different centers. Measuring 17-hydroxyprogesterone (Answer C) is the most appropriate next step. In some circumstances (mild symptoms without progression), physicians may choose to follow the child clinically with or without measurement of bone age. In this vignette, there was clinical progression, so further investigations were warranted. Bone age measurement can be helpful, and some clinicians recommend further evaluation if bone age is more than 2 years advanced for a patient’s given chronologic age. However, advanced bone age is common in premature adrenarche. With more frequent use of liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, increases in alternative steroids such as circulating 11-oxygenated androgens have been described in patients with premature adrenarche. 11-Ketotestosterone may be the dominant circulating bioactive androgen that results in the clinical features seen in premature adrenarche. Urinary steroid profiles (Answer E) are increasingly being used for the diagnosis of disorders of steroidogenesis, and with growing availability, this assessment will no doubt have clinical utility in the exclusion of other disorders of hyperandrogenism. Adrenal ultrasonography (Answer A) could be used to assist in the diagnosis of an adrenal tumor, although the study is user dependent. In this child with mild androgenization, the diagnosis is unlikely. The lack of breast development on clinical examination rules out central precocious puberty, so LH measurement (Answer B) is not necessary at this point. Measuring TSH (Answer D) could diagnose severe primary hypothyroidism, which has been associated with pseudoprecocious puberty (frequently with delayed bone age) presenting with breast development, galactorrhea, and menarche. This is also referred to as Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome. The mechanism leading to pseudoprecocious puberty in this setting is not entirely clear, although it is thought to be due to extremely high TSH acting on the FSH receptor, which stimulates the gonads. Clinically, this child does not have breast development; rather, she has advanced bone age and increased height velocity. Thus, Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome is an unlikely diagnosis and TSH measurement is not the best next step. Although premature adrenarche is considered a benign variant of maturation that is more common in girls than in boys and is associated with higher BMI, increased susceptibility to polycystic ovary syndrome and insulin resistance have been described in adults. Furthermore, rare disorders can present as premature adrenarche such as cortisone reductase deficiency due to inactivating pathogenic variants in the gene encoding the enzyme hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and cortisone reductase deficiency due to inactivating pathogenic variants in the HSD11B1 gene. Finally, a recent study highlighted that premature adrenarche is more common among black girls than among white girls and other racial groups. In black patients with premature adrenarche, the age at presentation is younger and there is a lower incidence of organic pathology. Hence, the age definition of premature adrenarche (<8 years in girls and <9 years in boys) may not be appropriate for patients of African American descent, and management may need to be stratified to account for ethnic background.",

She had menses monthly until approximately 8 months ago at which time menstrual periods ceased. She states that pregnancy is not a possibility and that she has otherwise been well. She has had no recent weight loss, vision problems, headaches, or breast discharge and takes no medications on a daily basis. Midparental target height is 65.5 in (166.4 cm).

Initiation of twice-weekly cabergoline and counseling for psychiatric disturbance.",
        "answer": "E. Initiation of cabergoline and counseling for psychiatric disturbance",
        "explanation": "This patient has hyperprolactinemia and an area of hypoenhancement of the pituitary measuring less than 10 mm, which is most consistent with a microprolactinoma. Prolactin-secreting tumors account for approximately 40% of all pituitary adenomas. Prolactinomas are rare in childhood, but the incidence increases in adolescence. Reproductive disturbances (amenorrhea and galactorrhea in girls and pubertal delay and hypogonadism in boys) are the most common presentation. Dopamine agonist therapy is recommended to lower prolactin levels, decrease tumor size, and restore gonadal function in patients with a microprolactinoma and symptoms of hyperprolactinemia, including hypogonadism (infertility, oligomenorrhea, galactorrhea, low bone density). Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine agonist that is generally recommended over bromocriptine because of better tolerance and greater efficacy in all endpoints. It should be noted that safety and efficacy have not been established in the pediatric population. Onset or exacerbation of impulse control disorders have been recognized as an adverse effect of dopamine agonist therapy, occurring in 17% of patients treated with cabergoline for prolactinoma in one uncontrolled study of 308 adult patients. A case study documented psychiatric disturbance in several children with prolactinoma treated with cabergoline at a median dosage of 0.5 mg weekly (range 0.25-2.0 mg weekly). In several patients, this necessitated a reduced cabergoline dosage. Given the potential risk of psychiatric disturbance with cabergoline treatment, patients should be counseled regarding this risk when starting treatment (Answer E). Diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia in an individual with a suspected prolactinoma is straightforward. The Endocrine Society guidelines recommend a single measurement of prolactin obtained without excessive venipuncture stress, as a single prolactin measurement is highly sensitive for hyperprolactinemia. Serial dilution of serum samples is recommended if there is a discrepancy between a large pituitary tumor and mildly elevated prolactin. This eliminates artifact with immunoradiometric assays that can lead to a falsely low prolactin value (“hook effect”). However, dynamic testing of prolactin secretion (Answer A) has not been shown to be superior to measurement of a single serum prolactin measurement. It is reasonable to defer treatment and monitor microadenomas that are not causing symptoms, as most microadenomas do not increase in size over time. However, the patient in this case has oligomenorrhea and low estradiol, so repeating prolactin measurement and brain MRI without initiating treatment (Answer C) is incorrect. Visual field deficits are a concern in patients presenting with macroadenoma due to compression of the optic chiasm. However, the presence of visual field defects in individuals with microadenomas would not be expected, as the tumor does not extend beyond the sella. As such, a neuro-ophthalmology examination (Answer B) is not required. Dopamine agonists are well known to cause fibrotic valvulopathy in a dose-dependent manner and most microadenomas respond to cabergoline dosages well under 2 mg weekly. As there is low risk of cabergoline associated valvulopathy at dosages used to treat macroprolactinomas, only patients taking a cabergoline dosage greater than 2 mg weekly require annual echocardiography (Answer D). Echocardiography before commencing dopamine agonist therapy followed by echocardiography at 5 years is recommended for patients taking a cabergoline dosage of 2 mg weekly or lower.",

This condition was first described by Russell in 1951. Linear  growth is usually maintained or only minimally affected in these children. Other features that can be observed in some children with diencephalic syndrome include hyperkinesis, emesis, and ophthalmologic findings such as nystagmus, optic pallor, or papilledema. Affected children usually attain developmental milestones appropriate for age. Some have hydrocephalus. A high index of suspicion should prompt brain MRI (Answer A), which would demonstrate tumor near the anterior hypothalamus and occasionally a brain tumor in the posterior fossa. Treatment considerations are focused on reducing the tumor burden. Differential diagnosis of failure to thrive during infancy is broad. However, this child has normal linear growth, no history of hypoglycemia, normal electrolytes and glucose, normal thyroid function, and a normal GH concentration. Thus, adrenal insufficiency or other endocrinopathies are less likely to be the cause of poor weight gain. Cortisol measurement and cosyntropin-stimulation testing (Answer B) are not necessary. The baby is happy and interactive with normal development and no history of fractures. Therefore, there is no need to obtain a skeletal survey (Answer C) or bone age x-ray (Answer D).

        "answer": "A. Elevated serum reverse T3",
        "explanation": "This infant presents at 6 weeks of age with primary hypothyroidism that was not present on newborn screening, suggesting a postnatally acquired cause. His findings of marked hepatomegaly and a cutaneous hemangioma suggest that the most likely cause is the presence of massive hepatic hemangiomas. These vascular lesions highly express type 3 deiodinase (D3), an enzyme that converts both T4 and T3 to the inactive metabolites reverse T3 and T2, respectively. Massive hemangiomas, which occur most often in the liver, can express sufficient amounts of D3 to produce consumptive hypothyroidism, which is characterized by elevated levels of reverse T3 (Answer A), low levels of T3 (not elevated [Answer C]), and, when severe, low levels of T4. Serum thyroglobulin levels are increased (not low [Answer B]) due to stimulation by elevated TSH. Because of the rapid degradation of circulating thyroid hormones, management consists of levothyroxine at high dosages, sometimes given twice daily due to its shortened serum half-life. Replacement of T3 also may be required in severe cases. Hemangiomas can cause severe complications including cardiac failure, but they usually regress over time, leading to resolution of consumptive hypothyroidism. Exposure to excess iodine—such as from topical iodine antiseptics, iodinated radiocontrast agents, or maternal iodine ingestion—can cause acquired hypothyroidism in infancy. In such cases, the urinary iodine concentration is elevated (Answer E). However, hepatomegaly is not characteristic of iodine-induced hypothyroidism, and there is no history of excess iodine exposure in this case. Maternal transfer of TSH-receptor antibodies that block TSH-receptor signaling (Answer D) is a rare cause of congenital hypothyroidism, which is unlikely in this patient with a normal newborn screen. Congenital hypothyroidism may be missed on newborn screening due to problems with the screening sample (including obtaining the sample after blood transfusion) or in infants who are preterm, of low birth weight, or are monozygotic twins; however, none of these risk factors is present in this case. Although a sample-handling error cannot be excluded based on the information provided, the physical findings in this patient are not typical of congenital hypothyroidism.",

        "question": "Which of the following is the most likely primary cause of this patient’s hyponatremia?",

        "answer": "D. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis",
        "explanation": "This hospitalized child who is undergoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia presented with hyponatremia and bacteremia. His blood pressure and heart rate were normal and there was no evidence of edema on examination, which together suggest a euvolemic state. Hyponatremia occurs commonly in hospitalized patients and has many contributing factors. The kidney’s ability to generate and excrete free water is the primary way the body defends against developing hyponatremia. With normal renal function, it is rare to develop hyponatremia from excess water ingestion, due to the ability of the kidneys to excrete large volumes of free water. Similarly, it is rare to develop hyponatremia from large renal losses alone without an excess of free water ingestion. It is arginine vasopressin (AVP), released from the posterior pituitary, that increases water permeability in the collecting tubules of the kidney. In addition to increases in serum osmolality, AVP release can be stimulated by both hemodynamic stimuli (eg, volume depletion, hypotension, congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, liver cirrhosis) and non-hemodynamic stimuli (eg, pain, stress, nausea, vomiting, medications, central nervous system disease, pulmonary disease, perioperative state, inflammation). Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) is a common cause of hyponatremia in hospitalized children. Patients with SIAD have hypotonic hyponatremia caused by impaired free water excretion due to excess AVP secretion from nonphysiologic stimuli, in the absence of endocrine or renal dysfunction. There are numerous causes of SIAD, but in children it most often results from central nervous system disorders, pulmonary disorders, malignancy, and medications (most commonly the anticonvulsant drugs carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine and the chemotherapeutic agents vincristine and cyclophosphamide). Patients with SIAD are typically euvolemic or have mild volume expansion. However, volume status is often difficult to assess accurately; therefore, SIAD is generally a diagnosis of exclusion. While there is no specific diagnostic test to confirm SIAD, hypouricemia with an elevated fractional excretion of urate is highly suggestive of SIAD. Other hallmarks of SIAD include mild volume expansion with low to normal plasma concentrations of creatinine, urea, uric acid, and potassium; impaired free water excretion with normal sodium excretion that reflects sodium intake; and hyponatremia that is relatively unresponsive to giving sodium without concomitant fluid restriction. Measurement of AVP or copeptin is not useful. Useful biochemical markers in adults include a spot urine sodium concentration greater than 30 mEq/L (>30 mmol/L), fractional excretion of sodium greater than 0.5%, fractional excretion of urea greater than 55%, fractional excretion of urate greater than 11%, and plasma uric acid less than 4 mg/dL (<237.9 μmol/L). In the workup of hyponatremia, it is important to distinguish true hypoosmolality from pseudohyponatremia (seen with hyperproteinemia or severe hyperlipidemia) or translocational hyponatremia (seen with hyperglycemia, mannitol, hypertonic radiocontrast). Urine osmolality should be measured to determine whether there is impaired free water clearance. Diseases causing decreased circulating volume, renal impairment, adrenal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism must be excluded. The patient in this vignette appears to be euvolemic. He has hyponatremia with true hypoosmolality. His serum uric acid concentration is very low and his urinary sodium excretion is elevated. Although he has bacteremia, his vital signs are not suggestive of sepsis. Therefore, he most likely has SIAD (Answer D) associated with vincristine chemotherapy. Severe hypertriglyceridemia causes pseudohyponatremia. While this child does have an elevated triglyceride concentration (Answer A), it is not high enough to cause this degree of hyponatremia. Cerebral/renal salt wasting (Answer B) can be very difficult to distinguish from SIAD, but it would be a more likely etiology if there were evidence of circulatory volume depletion. Hospitalized patients are at risk of developing hyponatremia if given excessive hypotonic fluids (Answer C). However, this patient was receiving isotonic fluids at a maintenance rate. Cortisol insufficiency (Answer E) can be associated with SIAD, as glucocorticoids have an inhibitory effect on AVP synthesis. Although this child has a very low cortisol level, this is most likely due to adrenal suppression from the dexamethasone he is currently receiving.",

        "explanation": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease due to excess fat accumulation in the liver. It has become the most common liver disease in children in western countries. The prevalence of pediatric NAFLD in the United States ranges from 29% to 38% in select studies. Male sex, older age, and ethnicity (Hispanic children have the highest risk) are all risk factors for NAFLD. Although data on the long-term complications resulting from pediatric NAFLD are limited, disease in children appears to be more severe than in adults. It is often asymptomatic and thus screening for NAFLD in at-risk patients is prudent, so that the condition can be recognized and treated before the onset of end-stage liver disease. According to the most recent pediatric guidelines, screening should be considered for all children with obesity aged 9 to 11 years and for children who are overweight who present with other risk factors such as insulin resistance, prediabetes/diabetes, dyslipidemia, or a family history of NAFLD/NASH. However, it may be prudent to screen younger patients who present with severe obesity or those with a positive family history of NAFLD/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. While ALT measurement (Answer C) has limitations, including the fact that optimal cutoffs have not been well established, it is inexpensive and is widely available as a screening tool. It has also been shown to correlate with the presence of hepatic steatosis. Recent standards have been proposed for normal cutoff values of ALT (≤26 U/L [≤0.43 μkat/L] for boys and ≤22 U/L [≤0.37 μkat/L] for girls). ALT values greater than 2 times the upper normal limit (ALT ≥50 U/L [≥0.84 μkat/L] for boys and ≥44 U/L [≥0.73 μkat/L] for girls) in overweight/obese children aged 10 years and older have a sensitivity of 88% for diagnosing NAFLD. AST (Answer B), as well as γ-glutamyl transferase, has not been tested independently for the purpose of screening in pediatric patients. Additionally, elevated AST or γ-glutamyl transferase may represent liver conditions other than NAFLD, particularly if the ALT concentration is normal. Abdominal ultrasonography (Answer A) is poor at detecting steatosis. Referral to gastroenterology (Answer D) could be considered in the face of an abnormal ALT value, but screening with ALT is a more appropriate starting place. Abdominal MRI (Answer E) has been validated and shown to be accurate for detection and quantification of hepatic steatosis in both adults and children; however, cost, lack of availability, and lack of validated cutoffs limit its current usefulness as a screening tool. Newer noninvasive diagnostic tools, such acoustic radiation force impact, transient elastography, and magnetic resonance elastography, are increasingly being used for the detection of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, although these still need to be validated in pediatric patients.",

        "options": "A. Strict bed rest until pain resolves; B. Lumbar spine DXA, if results are normal, no further imaging is indicated; C. Lumbar spine DXA and vertebral fracture analysis by DXA; D. Lumbar spine DXA and dedicated spine x-rays; E. Bisphosphonate therapy for treatment of vertebral compression fractures",
        "answer": "C. Lumbar spine DXA and vertebral fracture analysis by DXA",
        "explanation": "Atraumatic vertebral compression fractures alone are sufficient to diagnose pediatric osteoporosis. While many adult guidelines define chronic steroid exposure as at least 3 months or more of greater than 7.5 mg daily of prednisone equivalents, work from the Steroid-Induced Osteoporosis in the Pediatric Population program identified that pediatric patients may present with vertebral compression fractures within 30 days of starting glucocorticoid therapy. Risk factors include greater cumulative glucocorticoid exposure, increased BMI (likely secondary to the cushingoid effect from high-dosage glucocorticoids), and lower bone mineral density. This patient is at high risk for vertebral compression fractures. Strict bed rest (Answer A) can further compromise skeletal health by leading to muscle deconditioning and bone loss from immobility. In fact, physical therapy is still recommended for patients with vertebral compression fractures to strengthen core muscles. Imaging can help guide the treatment plan, as the presence of 1 atraumatic vertebral compression fracture is sufficient for the diagnosis of pediatric osteoporosis. Bone density assessment by DXA now is important to assess the patient’s current bone health, as well as to monitor response to treatment interventions over time. Importantly, vertebral compression fractures can occur even with a normal bone mineral density Z-score (thus, Answer B is incorrect). One also must be cautious interpreting a lumbar spine bone mineral density Z-score result alone without review of the DXA image itself, as a vertebral compression fracture could result in false elevation of bone mineral density. While DXA images can suggest the presence of a vertebral compression fracture, dedicated spine imaging is recommended. The most recent pediatric position statement developed by the International Society for Clinical Densitometry in 2019 supports the validity of vertebral fracture analysis via DXA (Answer C) to detect vertebral compression fractures in at-risk children when images are interpreted by a clinician with experience in pediatric vertebral development. Anterior wedging may be present as part of normal physiologic development, especially in the mid-thoracic region where most vertebral compression fractures occur. Reliance on DXA manufacturer software would thus potentially overdiagnose vertebral deformities in children. Vertebral fracture analysis has similar sensitivity and specificity to that of standard spine radiographs to detect moderate to severe vertebral compression fractures (>25%), but requires less than half of the amount of radiation. Vertebral fracture analysis by DXA does have limited ability to detect mild vertebral compression fractures (20%-25% height loss), especially in the upper thoracic spine (T4-T7); however, standard radiographs also have this limitation secondary to the overlying soft tissue and other organs in that region. Therefore, the new guidelines are that vertebral fracture analysis by DXA is a reasonable first-line assessment for patients at high risk for vertebral compression fractures, followed by spine radiograph (Answer D) or MRI only if the vertebrae are unable to be measured accurately. In centers without this expertise, it may be appropriate to obtain standard radiographs initially. While this child complained of back pain, it is important to be aware that nearly half of vertebral compression fractures in at-risk populations are asymptomatic. Therefore, monitoring an objective measure of spine health should be considered when patients are at increased risk for vertebral compression. Children with sufficient remaining linear growth have the ability to recover the vertebral height loss without the use of antiresorptive agents such as bisphosphonates (Answer E) if risk factors for osteoporosis are mitigated (ie, cessation of glucocorticoid therapy). It is unknown how much growth potential must remain, but given the fact that this child is prepubertal, bisphosphonate therapy may not be necessary if she is able to discontinue the high-dosage glucocorticoid therapy and undergo remission.",

"071": {"case": "A 16-year-old girl has been aware of a lump in the left side of her neck for the past few months. At her annual well-child visit, her pediatrician orders ultrasonography, which shows a thyroid nodule in the left lobe measuring 5 cm with features suspicious for thyroid cancer. It is solid and hypoechoic and has a few microcalcifications. There is no evidence of the nodule invading the capsule and no cervical lymphadenopathy. Thyroid cancer is suspected, and she is referred to pediatric endocrinology for ultrasound-guided FNA and laboratory tests. The FNA is interpreted to be papillary thyroid cancer. Given the large nodule, neck CT is performed before total thyroidectomy, and it shows no cervical lymph nodes. Her preoperative thyroid function is normal and TPO and thyroglobulin antibodies are negative. Total thyroidectomy is uneventful. No neck dissection is performed based on her CT and ultrasonography staging. Pathologic examination confirms the diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer in the left lobe, and no evidence of thyroid cancer is noted in the right lobe. The tumor does not invade the capsule and there is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion.

        "answer": "D. Assess thyroid function now and aim for a TSH concentration 0.5-1.0 mIU/L; measure thyroglobulin in 2 to 3 months while on levothyroxine",
        "explanation": "The recent 2015 pediatric guidelines from the American Thyroid Association classify the risk of having persistent cervical disease and/or distant metastases after thyroidectomy with/without cervical lymph node dissection. The mortality risk from thyroid cancer is very low in pediatric patients. The risk assessment is used to guide the management and monitoring of patients with non-medullary differentiated thyroid cancer and is geared primarily toward papillary thyroid cancer or the follicular variant of papillary thyroid cancer. The American Thyroid Association pediatric low-risk designation is reserved for thyroid cancer grossly confined to the thyroid with N0/Nx (no metastatic lymph node/s found, or no lymph node/s checked) or incidental N1a (microscopic metastasis to a small number of central neck [level 6] lymph nodes). The American Thyroid Association pediatric intermediate-risk designation defines those with extensive N1a or minimal N1b (lateral neck), whereas the high-risk designation defines those with regionally extensive disease (extensive N1b) or locally invasive disease (T4 tumors per the American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] Tumor, Node, Metastasis [TNM] classification), with or without distant metastasis (typically pulmonary). Both intermediate- and high-risk cancers require stimulated thyroglobulin measurement and whole-body 123I scan to better stage them postoperatively and decide whether 131I radioablation and/or additional surgery is required. Thyroglobulin antibodies should be confirmed to be undetectable to ensure that the thyroglobulin level in a routine panel is reliable. Although this patient’s large tumor size would make it more likely for her to be in a higher risk group, her tumor does not manifest any aggressive features such as invasion of the capsule or lymphatic or vascular invasion. She is in the N0/Nx category and is therefore in the low-risk group. As a result, this patient’s goal TSH concentration is 0.5 to 1.0 mIU/L, and nonstimulated (basal) thyroglobulin should be measured within 12 weeks of surgery (Answer D). Patients in the high-risk group and some in the intermediate-risk group who require 131I (Answer A) receive it after review of the results of the stimulated thyroglobulin measurement and 123I whole-body scan. The TSH cutoffs in Answer B (TSH cutoff is for high risk) and Answer C (TSH cutoff is for intermediate risk) are incorrect. Stimulated thyroglobulin and a whole-body scan (Answer E) are not recommended for patients at low risk.",

"072": {"case": "A 3-year-old boy presents with lower-extremity bowing. He was born at 28 weeks’ gestation, and the neonatal course was complicated by prolonged use of total parenteral nutrition due to necrotizing enterocolitis. He has been on full enteral feeds since approximately 4 months of age and now consumes 24 oz of milk daily. He also takes a chewable multivitamin. He did not start walking until 18 months of age, which the family attributes to his prematurity. His parents initially noted the bowing deformity at that time and report that it appears to have worsened over the last year. The child is now in preschool and his parents note that compared with other children in his class, he seems to rest more often on the playground. Growth parameters, adjusted for prematurity, have been normal. Dentition is normal. Family history is relevant for recurrent stress fractures in the mother who is a marathon runner. Laboratory test results: Calcium = 9.8 mg/dL (8.3-10.6 mg/dL) (SI: 2.5 mmol/L [2.1-2.7 mmol/L]); Phosphate = 7.7 mg/dL (4.0-6.8 mg/dL) (SI: 2.5 mmol/L [1.3-2.2 mmol/L]); 25-Hydroxyvitamin D = 73 ng/dL (20-60 ng/dL) (SI: 182.2 nmol/L [49.9-149.8 nmol/L]); Alkaline phosphatase = 76 U/L (78-300 U/L) (SI: 1.27 μkat/L [1.22-5.01 μkat/L]); PTH = 16 pg/mL (15-87 pg/mL) (SI: 16 ng/L [15-87 ng/L]).",
        "question": "Which of the following is this child’s most likely diagnosis?",
        "options": "A. Vitamin D intoxication; B. Hypoparathyroidism; C. Physiologic bowing; D. Hypophosphatasia; E. Rickets of prematurity.",
        "answer": "D. Hypophosphatasia",
        "explanation": "The most notable finding in this child is the low serum alkaline phosphatase concentration. While the reported value is just outside of the reference range, it is important to remember that children have significantly higher levels of alkaline phosphatase than adults, and levels less than 100 U/L (<1.67 μkat/L) should raise concern when there are physical signs of rickets. Hypophosphatasia (Answer D) occurs in 1 in 100,000 live births and is due to loss-of-function pathogenic variants in the ALPL gene, which encodes tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. Inadequate action of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase results in accumulation of the substrate inorganic pyrophosphate, which is a potent inhibitor of mineralization. The spectrum of disease includes perinatal lethal, infantile-onset, childhood-onset, and adult-onset forms, as well as odontohypophosphatasia (premature tooth loss alone without a skeletal phenotype). The phenotype is related to the residual function of the enzyme. Skeletal manifestations include craniosynostosis, rickets, bone and joint pain, fractures or pseudofractures, and the hallmark premature loss (before age 5 years) of primary teeth with the root intact. Radiographs show “radiolucent tongues” extending from the growth plate into the metaphysis. The infantile form presents with respiratory issues due to an underdeveloped thoracic cage, hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia due to inability to deposit mineral into bone, nephrocalcinosis, and seizures responsive to vitamin B6. Some children present with weakness, delayed walking, and a waddling gait. Adult forms can present with recurrent metatarsal stress fractures, loss of adult dentition, osteomalacia, and pseudogout. Ongoing data collection suggests that bisphosphonate use in adults with hypophosphatasia may result in an increased risk for atypical femur fractures. In 2015, the enzyme replacement therapy asfotase alfa became clinically available to treat this disorder. Treatment with asfotase alfa results in improved skeletal mineralization, respiratory function, growth, and cognitive and motor function for the infantile and childhood forms, as well as improved bone mineralization, motor function, muscle strength, and patient-reported function in adolescents and adults. While the mother’s recurrent stress fractures may be secondary to her training for marathons, it would be reasonable to measure her alkaline phosphatase level. It is also important to ensure age-specific reference ranges are reported, as alkaline phosphatase levels are significantly higher in children than in adults. The differential diagnosis of low serum alkaline phosphatase is broad and includes vitamin D intoxication, hypoparathyroidism, zinc deficiency, magnesium deficiency, celiac disease, Wilson disease, Cushing syndrome, hypothyroidism, pernicious anemia, osteogenesis imperfecta type 2, and cleidocranial dysostosis. Vitamin D intoxication (Answer A) leads to hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and low serum alkaline phosphatase; however, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values are generally above 100 ng/dL (>249.6 nmol/L). Lower-extremity bowing deformities are not part of the clinical presentation. This patient’s PTH was low-normal with a mildly elevated phosphate concentration and normal serum calcium concentration appropriate for the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. Thus, he does not have hypoparathyroidism (Answer B). Risk factors for rickets of prematurity (Answer E) include gestational age less than 27 weeks, birth weight less than 2 lb 3 oz (<1000 g), prolonged use of total parental nutrition (>4 weeks), history of necrotizing enterocolitis, and prolonged postnatal steroid use. Biochemical changes of low serum phosphate and elevated alkaline phosphatase present between 3 and 14 weeks of life due to the inability to replicate the extensive skeletal uptake of calcium by the fetus during the third trimester. While physical changes are rare, some cases can manifest with fractures. Although this child was at risk for rickets of prematurity, his symptoms are progressing, whereas rickets of prematurity is self-resolving and there is little evidence for long-term consequences on bone health. Physiologic bowing (Answer C) is certainly a possibility; however, the alkaline phosphatase concentration is frankly low.",

        "explanation": "The patient in this vignette has a testicular volume less than 3 mL at 15 years of age. The differential diagnosis includes constitutional delay of growth and puberty vs primary or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The history of cryptorchidism, hyposmia, and hypogonadism is most consistent with a diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome, which results from a defect in formation of the olfactory placode during embryonic development. This causes loss of olfactory nerve fibers and failure of GnRH neuron migration to the hypothalamus. Low inhibin B, antimullerian hormone, and FSH levels (Answer A) are consistently found in patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to Kallmann syndrome. Distinguishing hypogonadotropic hypogonadism from constitutional delay is challenging but can be based on certain features, including absent or diminished sense of smell and the finding of a hypoplastic olfactory bulb on brain MRI. Other findings that are suggestive of Kallmann syndrome include micropenis, cryptorchidism, and synkinesia (mirror movements of the hands). While more than 25 genes involved in Kallmann syndrome have been identified, a genetic cause is not found in nearly half of cases. In children with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, inadequate low FSH levels and consequent failure of Sertoli-cell proliferation result in decreased production and secretion of peptide hormones, including inhibin B and antimullerian hormone. As such, inhibin B and antimullerian hormone levels are helpful in distinguishing constitutional delay of growth and puberty from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Children with constitutional delay of growth and puberty have normal inhibin B and antimullerian hormone levels before onset of puberty. In contrast, both inhibin B and antimullerian hormone are low in children with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Antimullerian hormone levels peak in the first year of life and stay elevated throughout childhood. Antimullerian hormone levels decrease in puberty due to inhibition by testosterone. Pubertal-aged individuals with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism have antimullerian hormone levels that are low when compared with the normal prepubertal range due to FSH deficiency but are high for age due to lack of testosterone inhibition. Inhibin B levels remain detectable throughout childhood and then rise in puberty along with FSH levels. Inhibin B concentrations are significantly lower in individuals with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism than in those with constitutional delay of growth and puberty; a cutoff of 61 pg/mL (61 ng/L) has 90% sensitivity and 83% specificity for detecting hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which makes inhibin B a useful marker for detection.",

"074": {"case": "A 6-and-2/12-year-old boy with Prader-Willi syndrome presents to the clinic for follow-up. He was born at full term. Birth weight and length were adequate for gestational age. He was noted to have significant hypotonia at birth and had dysmorphic features, including narrow biparietal diameter and undescended testes. He had issues with feeding and required a nasogastric tube and, later, a gastrostomy tube. The suspicion of Prader-Willi syndrome was confirmed with fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. At age 14 months, his length was below the 3rd percentile for age (SDS, –2.2) and weight was at the 4th percentile for age (SDS, –1.75). Given the reported benefits of GH therapy started early in children with Prader-Willi syndrome, he underwent a sleep study to rule out significant obstructive sleep apnea. The sleep study showed mild obstructive sleep apnea, as well as a component of central apnea. GH therapy was started at age 16 months when his length was 28.9 in (73.4 cm) (<3rd percentile; SDS, –2.18), weight was 20.9 lb (9.5 kg) (5th percentile; SDS, –1.64), and body surface area was 0.422 m2. The initial GH dosage was 0.2 mg subcutaneously once daily (0.47 mg/m2 daily or 0.15 mg/kg per week). Close surveillance with overnight pulse oximetry was recommended. Now, at age 6-and-2/12 years, his height is 42.9 in (109 cm) (7th percentile; SDS, –1.46), weight is 44.7 lb (20.3 kg) (39th percentile; SDS, –0.27), and BMI is 17.1 kg/m2 (85th percentile; SDS, +1.05). His body surface area is 0.775 m2. He grew 1.5 in (3.8 cm) in the last 6 months, rendering a growth velocity of 7.6 cm/y. He has been doing well with the GH injections without evidence of adverse effects or worrisome signs or symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, enuresis, headaches, or vision changes. His mother reports that since the initiation of GH therapy, the frequency of oxygen desaturations has decreased. She has also noticed continued improvement in his muscle tone, a finding that was corroborated in a recent follow-up appointment in neurology. His GH dosage is 0.7 mg subcutaneously once daily (0.24 mg/kg per week). Laboratory test results: IGFBP-3 = 3.7 mg/L (1.5-3.4 mg/L); IGF-1 = 215 ng/mL (60-228 ng/mL) (SI: 28.2 nmol/L [7.86-29.9 nmol/L]); IGF-1 Z-score = +2.49; Random glucose = 128 mg/dL (70-100 mg/dL) (SI: 7.1 mmol/L [3.9-5.56 mmol/L]); Hemoglobin A1c = 5.5% (4.3%-5.7%) (SI: 37 mmol/mol [23-39 mmol/mol]); TSH = 6.2 mIU/L (0.8-8.2 mIU/L); Free T4 = 1.35 ng/dL (0.8-1.8 ng/dL) (SI: 17.4 pmol/L [10.3-23.2 pmol/L]); 25-Hydroxyvitamin D = 30 ng/mL (25-100 ng/mL) (SI: 74.9 nmol/L [62.4-249.6 nmol/L]).",

        "answer": "C. Decrease the GH dosage",
        "explanation": "In June 2000, GH therapy was approved by the US FDA for the management of growth failure associated with Prader-Willi syndrome based on studies showing an improvement in linear growth and body composition (decrease in fat mass and increase in lean mass) in these children. IGF-1 is a useful indicator of GH dosage adequacy in children with idiopathic GH deficiency. Higher IGF-1 levels have been observed in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome in response to standard dosages of GH when compared with IGF-1 levels in children without Prader-Willis syndrome. The possibility of higher sensitivity to GH therapy is thought to be a possible mechanism. An alternative mechanism has been proposed for this finding. In children with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with GH, most of the IGF-1 is sequestered in the 150-kDa complex with IGFBP-3 and acid-labile subunit, decreasing the proportion of bioactive IGF-1. This has led to the proposal that elevated IGF-1 levels are not a reason to decrease the GH dosage in these individuals because there is no good correlation between serum immunoreactive IGF-1 and bioactive IGF-1 in children with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with GH. However, the clinical consensus guidelines still recommend guiding the dosing of GH in patients with Prader-Willi based on clinical response and recommend maintaining IGF-1 levels within the physiological range. This child’s IGF-1 is elevated (SDS >+2); therefore, a decrease in the GH dosage (Answer C) is the best next step. Continuation of the current GH dosage (Answer A) is not the preferred next step despite the reported good response to therapy. The recommended initial dosage of GH in children with Prader-Willi syndrome is 0.5 mg/m2 daily with dosage titration to 1 mg/m2 daily based on clinical response and IGF-1 measurements. High levels of IGF-1 are associated with lymphoid hyperplasia, which can worsen obstructive sleep apnea. On the basis of several reports of sudden death occurring shortly after initiation of GH therapy in children with Prader-Willi syndrome, a warning was added to the prescribing recommendations, specifically in patients with preexisting significant obesity and severe respiratory impairment. Polysomnography (sleep study) and otolaryngology evaluation of the upper airway are recommended before initiation of GH therapy. Some authors also recommend a repeated sleep study approximately 6 months after therapy initiation. While GH, an insulin counterregulatory hormone, increases insulin resistance and the risk of dysglycemia/ hyperglycemia, especially in individuals with obesity, the screening laboratory tests in this vignette (random glucose and hemoglobin A1c) are normal and not suggestive of an alteration of carbohydrate metabolism at this time. Thus, an oral glucose tolerance test (Answer D) is not the best next step. Children with Prader-Willi syndrome may have hypothalamic dysfunction, which can be associated with central hypothyroidism. This child’s thyroid function is normal and does not warrant thyroid hormone replacement now (Answer B). This patient’s vitamin D level is normal, so there is no indication for vitamin D therapy (Answer E). Nevertheless, it is advised to ensure adequate maintenance of vitamin D levels through feeds or supplementation.",

        "explanation": "Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas caused by pathogenic variants in the VHL gene (Answer B), associated with von Hippel–Lindau syndrome, have a noradrenergic biochemical profile, unlike tumors associated with RET (Answer A), TMEM127 (Answer C), and NF1 (Answer D), which show adrenergic predominance. Pathogenic variants in the SDHC gene (Answer E) can be associated with tumors that have a noradrenergic biochemical profile, but these variants tend to cause solitary head and neck paragangliomas. The Endocrine Society guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas advocate that genetic testing be considered in all patients independent of a clear family history. This is consistent with other practice guidelines and consensus statements from expert groups, as 40% to 50% of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are associated with pathogenic variants in known causative genes. More than 12 genes are associated with pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. Some of these are associated with distinct clinical syndromes and predominant biochemical profiles. The most commonly associated genes in pediatric patients are VHL and SDHB. The presence of additional features can often help determine which candidate gene to test: for example, retinal angiomas in von Hippel–Lindau syndrome; a thyroid mass in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2; cafe-au-lait spots, axillary and inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules on the iris, and subcutaneous neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis type 1; and a neck mass in paraganglioma syndromes. A number of algorithms for genetic testing have been developed depending on whether the genetic testing is undertaken by candidate gene Sanger sequencing, gene panel, or next-generation sequencing. In the absence of syndromic features, the pathways account for the presence or absence of metastasis, location of paragangliomas, extra-adrenal or adrenal disease, unilateral/bilateral disease, and secretory biochemical phenotypes. In the case of isolated adrenal disease with a noradrenergic secretory phenotype, VHL genetic testing is recommended. Increasingly, the diagnosis of pathogenic variants is through use of gene panels and next-generation sequencing. A consensus statement on next-generation sequencing in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas was published in 2017, and it recommends the use of a validated targeted gene panel for the clinical genetic diagnosis of hereditary pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. Although next-generation sequencing is increasingly used in research, there are concerns that without a rigorous pipeline to interpret the data, high-throughput sequencing methods may lead to false-positive results with many variants of unknown significance reported as causative.

        "explanation": "Elevated hemoglobin A1c levels in the double digits are associated with long-term microvascular complications, as demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and in many studies since then. Recent data in adult populations suggest that the glycemic excursions are as concerning as elevated hemoglobin A1c levels. Even with the same hemoglobin A1c level, patients with much wider glycemic fluctuations have an increased risk of complications. This vignette is a good example of glycemic variability that can be simply defined as the degree to which the patient’s blood glucose level fluctuates between high (peaks) and low (nadir) levels. These patients are at greater risk of developing microvascular complications in the short- and long-term. These complications include, but are not limited to, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. The risk of retinopathy is far greater than any other complications at this stage; therefore, the first referral should be to an ophthalmologist (Answer D). In a published study, the retinopathy risk doubled when glycemic variation worsened. Referring this patient to a cardiologist (Answer A) could be considered because cardiac autonomic neuropathy, defined as measurement of heart rate variability assessed by 10-minute continuous electrocardiography, is a potential complication. However, the patient is not reporting any symptoms and is able to tolerate exercise. He is indeed at increased risk of microalbuminuria and nephropathy, which may require consultation with a nephrologist (Answer B).

She has a history of microcephaly, midface hypoplasia, hypoplastic optic nerves, mega cisterna magna, autism spectrum disorder, and mild global developmental delay. She has normal appetite, thirst, bowel movements, and urination. Whole-exome sequencing done at 6 months of age (ordered by a geneticist) identified a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the IGF1R gene (Arg739Trp). She has not had any hospital admissions since birth. Review of her growth chart shows that since infancy, her length and height have been at less than the first percentile and her weight has been at the third percentile.

Furthermore, results of the whole-exome sequencing confirmed a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the IGF1R gene. The IGF-1 receptor is a heterotetrameric transmembrane glycoprotein encoded by IGF1R. It consists of an α-subunit, involved in ligand binding, and a β-subunit, accounting for the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (Answer B). IGF1R is located on the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q26.3). Patients with pathogenic variants in the IGF1R gene and those who have 15q deletions that include IGF1R may exhibit clinical signs and symptoms of IGF-1 resistance. The serum IGF-1 level in these patients can be normal or high, and the phenotype is variable. GH therapy has been shown to have moderate effects when used to treat short stature in these patients.

        "answer": "E. Urinary iodine",
        "explanation": "This infant presents several weeks after birth with severe primary hypothyroidism that was not documented on newborn screening, suggesting a postnatally acquired cause. The patient’s mother reports consuming a significant amount of a traditional Korean soup, which may contain large amounts of iodine from seaweed that can be transmitted to the infant through breastmilk. Exposure of infants to excess iodine, such as from topical iodine antiseptics, iodinated radiocontrast agents, or maternal iodine ingestion, can cause acquired hypothyroidism in infancy. In such cases, the urinary iodine concentration is elevated (Answer E). Excess maternal iodine ingestion from seaweed soup has been reported to cause hypothyroidism in term and preterm infants and is particularly common in Asia. In this case, the infant’s urinary iodine concentration was 1830 mg/L (regional median 197 mg/L), and the mother’s breastmilk iodine concentration was 3023 mg/L (regional median 45-155 mg/L). Management consists of discontinuing the source of excess maternal iodine ingestion. There is minimal evidence regarding the time required to normalize the breastmilk iodine concentration, but in one reported case, the maternal urinary iodine concentration was normal 4 weeks after stopping seaweed ingestion. If the infant’s hypothyroidism is overt (as in this case), temporary levothyroxine treatment may be necessary. Increased serum reverse T3 (Answer A) and low serum T3 (Answer C) are observed in consumptive hypothyroidism, which is caused by massive hepatic hemangiomas that overexpress the type 3 deiodinase enzyme. This infant has no clinical evidence of such a process, such as hepatomegaly or cutaneous hemangiomas. Maternal transfer of TSH-receptor antibodies (Answer D) that block TSH-receptor signaling is a rare cause of congenital hypothyroidism, which is unlikely in this patient with a normal newborn screen. In addition, such antibodies generally result in a small (not normal-sized) thyroid gland by blocking the trophic effect of TSH on thyroid follicular cells. TPO antibodies (Answer B) are diagnostic of autoimmune thyroid disease, which is the most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism in childhood and adolescence. Autoimmune thyroid disease generally does not arise in the neonatal period and is unlikely to be the cause of this patient’s hypothyroidism. Although maternal TPO antibodies may be transmitted to a fetus across the placenta, these antibodies are nonfunctional and do not cause hypothyroidism.",

Approximately 1 year ago, she required significant alteration in management of hypocalcemia with increasing dosages of calcium and calcitriol supplementation. Because of her malabsorption, she was eventually transitioned to recombinant PTH given once every evening with calcium carbonate supplementation continued once daily in the early afternoon. With this approach, her serum calcium levels have been stable. On physical examination, the patient is thin. She has lost 6.6 lb (3 kg) since her last visit 6 months ago.

        "answer": "A. Screen for adrenal insufficiency",
        "explanation": "Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS) type 1 is a rare autosomal recessive condition due to loss of function of the autoimmune regulator gene (AIRE), which results in inappropriate expression of organ-specific T cells from the thymus. Classic manifestations include mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism (80% with mean age of presentation at 9 years), and primary adrenal insufficiency (90% with mean age of presentation of 14 years). Additional endocrine comorbidities may include oophoritis (70%), testicular failure (30%), type 1 diabetes mellitus (30%), hypothyroidism (30%), and hypophysitis (30%). Given her age, weight loss, and symptoms, the most important next step in this patient’s management is screening for adrenal insufficiency (Answer A). While the pathophysiology of hypercalcemia in adrenal insufficiency is unclear, it is reported in 5% to 6% of new diagnoses. Proposed mechanisms include decreased glomerular filtration of calcium due to hypovolemia and loss of glucocorticoid inhibition of 1α-hydroxylase leading to enhanced enteral calcium absorption. The pathogenesis of hypoparathyroidism in autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 is thought to be secondary to development of antibodies against PTH, the calcium-sensing receptor, or the NACHT leucine-rich repeats present in the parathyroid gland. Management of hypoparathyroidism can be especially challenging in patients with gastrointestinal comorbidities. Classic treatment approaches have focused on multiple daily doses of enteral calcium and active vitamin D. In recent years, recombinant PTH has been used to treat adult hypoparathyroidism and bypass the need for enteral absorption. Once-daily injections of recombinant 1-84 PTH demonstrate mean peak serum calcium levels 10 to 12 hours after the dose with sustained increases above baseline for 24 hours despite the half-life of the medication being only 3 hours. Recombinant 1-84 PTH is detected in the serum assay and was already low at the time of hypercalcemia. Reducing her dosage (Answer D) or discontinuing calcium carbonate (Answer E), are potential options to address the hypercalcemia, but neither option addresses the need to rule out adrenal insufficiency. In addition, given the half-life of calcium carbonate, this afternoon dose is unlikely to be affecting the morning serum calcium levels. While patients with APS type 1 are at increased risk for primary ovarian insufficiency, this patient has started puberty and is progressing at a typical tempo given her Tanner stage 4 breast development. Thus, screening for ovarian insufficiency (Answer B) is not needed now. Hyperthyroidism is a potential cause of hypercalcemia and can present with weight loss, fatigue, and diarrhea; however, the patient does not have tachycardia nor hypertension. In addition, hyperthyroidism is a feature of APS type 2, not APS type 1. Therefore, thyroid function tests (Answer C) are not the best next step.",

Increase in weight percentile associated with an increased interest in food; D. Maintenance of weight along the same percentile; E. Failure to thrive with difficulty gaining weight.",
        "answer": "B. Increase in weight percentile without appreciable changes in appetite or calories",
        "explanation": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex imprinted condition with the majority of cases due to deletions in the 15q11.2-q13 region of the paternally inherited chromosome. Obesity, intellectual disability, hypotonia, behavioral challenges, and neuroendocrine dysfunction have been commonly described. In the past, it was thought that there were only 2 nutritional phases associated with PWS (stage 1 with hypotonia and poor feeding in infancy, followed by stage 2 with hyperphagia and rapid weight gain in childhood). However, the nutritional stages are now known to be much more complex than previously recognized. Five main stages have been described with subphases in phase 1 and 2. Infants with PWS are characteristically hypotonic and have difficulty feeding (Answer E). This phase (phase 1a) can occur between birth and 15 months of age. Infants in this stage may have failure to thrive as a result of feeding difficulties. In late infancy (between 9 and 15 months), there is phase 1b in which infants track along their growth percentile without excess weight gain (Answer D). Toddlers (median age 2.08 years; age quartiles 20-31 months), such as the patient in this vignette, are most typically described as being in phase 2a in which there is a weight increase that occurs without a change in appetite or calories consumed (Answer B). Whether this weight gain is due to a change in metabolic rate and/or other factors is not known. To avoid excess weight gain at this stage, it is thought that calories consumed must be restricted to 50% to 80% of the recommended daily allowance for age. In phase 2b, which occurs at a median age of 4.5 years, there is an increasing interest in food, coupled with increased caloric intake and weight gain (Answer C). Hyperphagia with food-seeking and lack of satiety (Answer A) occurs later than previously thought at a median age of 8 years (phase 3). It is important to note that not all children with PWS go through all 5 stages, but patients and families should be informed of the possible stages and counseled accordingly regarding appropriate management.",

        "answer": "A. Arginine inhibits somatostatin",
        "explanation": "Many secretagogues can be used for provocative GH-stimulation testing, including insulin, arginine, glucagon, propranolol, clonidine, and levodopa. GHRH and exercise can also stimulate GH release. Provocative testing is by nature nonphysiologic and the precise mechanisms by which these agents stimulate GH are not fully understood. However, many affect GH release by suppressing somatostatin or stimulating GHRH release. Pulsatile GH secretion is in part regulated by the hypothalamic regulatory peptides GHRH and somatostatin (somatotropin release–inhibiting factor). GHRH release is stimulated by α2 adrenergic agonists, including clonidine, dopaminergic agonists (eg, levodopa), and exercise. Somatostatin secretion is stimulated by GHRH, dopaminergic, β-adrenergic stimulation, and GH and IGF-1 feedback. Somatostatin is inhibited by arginine, cholinergic GABAergic stimulation, and insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Arginine appears to cause GH release by inhibiting somatostatin and thereby increasing GHRH activity (Answer A). Glucagon (Answer B) may work by inducing a relative hypoglycemia following hyperglycemia, although the exact mechanism is not fully understood. Propranolol (Answer C) is a β-adrenergic antagonist, which would be expected to inhibit somatostatin. Clonidine (Answer D) stimulates α2 adrenergic receptors, which would increase GHRH.

Pathogenic variants in MRAP (Answer B), POR (Answer C), AIRE (Answer D), and AAAS (Answer E) can all give rise to primary adrenal insufficiency, but they are not associated with nephrotic syndrome. Since the first description in 2017, more than 35 patients carrying a pathogenic variant in the SGPL1 gene in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state have been reported worldwide. The clinical presentation and phenotypes are variable. Most affected patients have steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome presenting from birth to 19 years of age. Just over half of all those with SGPL1 pathogenic variants have glucocorticoid deficiency (with or without mineralocorticoid deficiency). Primary adrenal insufficiency can present from infancy to age 11 years. Some patients have adrenal calcification on imaging. Associated features reported include ichthyosis, neurologic involvement, and lymphopenia. Neurologic involvement is diverse and ranges from early developmental delay, microcephaly, seizures, and sensorineural deafness to late presentation with abnormal gait, peripheral neuropathy, and progressive neurologic deficit. In addition to primary adrenal insufficiency, multiple endocrinopathies such as primary hypothyroidism and gonadal dysfunction have also been described. Dysmorphic features and bone defects have been reported in a few patients. Fetal demise and hydrops fetalis have also been noted in some families. Deficiency of the SGPL1 protein represents a novel form of sphingolipidosis. Other forms include Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, and Niemann‐Pick disease. The SGPL1 protein is an intracellular enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of sphingolipids by cleaving substrate, sphingosine‐1‐phosphate (S1P), in the final step in the sphingolipid degradation pathway. S1P is a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite that acts on the family of 5 G-protein-coupled receptors to mediate diverse biologic activities, including angiogenesis, immune-cell trafficking, stemcell differentiation, and programmed cell death. Inactive SGPL1 leads to an accumulation of sphingolipids and ceramides. Accumulation of ceramides induces apoptosis, while sphingosine is a ligand for steroidogenic factor 1, inhibiting steroidogenesis by maintaining steroidogenic factor 1 in an inactive conformation. More recently, SGPL1 deficiency has been shown to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of this disorder.",

        "answer": "E. Methylation analysis of chromosome 11p15",
        "explanation": "This child has significant short stature with a history of prenatal growth restriction. Target height (midparental height) is at the 25th percentile. This, and the severity of his short stature, makes familial short stature an unlikely cause of his growth pattern. Hypothyroidism, inflammatory bowel disease, and celiac disease are also unlikely given his normal thyroid function, normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and negative celiac screen. His IGF-1 concentration is in the midpoint of the reference range for age, and his IGFBP-3 concentration is in the upper half of the reference range, which is not consistent with GH deficiency. Therefore, an arginine-insulin tolerance test (Answer A) for diagnostic purposes is not the best option. Additionally, this child was small-for-gestational-age and did not display “catch-up” growth during the first 4 years of life. He is a candidate for GH therapy based on the diagnosis of being small-for-gestational-age without catch-up growth. A GH-stimulation test would not be required to receive GH therapy. Although this child is described as having café-au-lait spots, which can be seen in neurofibromatosis type 1 (Answer B), the other clinical manifestations in this case, particularly the significant short stature, are not typical of this condition. Prenatal and postnatal growth restriction have also been described in individuals with defects in the gene encoding the IGF-1 receptor (Answer D). Elevated IGF-1 levels are described in these individuals and, although not present in all, some dysmorphic features such as microcephaly (as opposed to relative macrocephaly described in this vignette) are seen. Therefore, sequencing this gene is incorrect. The child in this vignette has clinical manifestations consistent with Silver-Russell syndrome, including prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, prominent forehead, triangular face, asymmetric growth of the extremities, and café-au-lait spots. Multiple types of Silver-Russell syndrome have been reported to date. Approximately 50% of affected children carry an epimutation consisting of hypomethylation of the imprinting control region 1 (ICR1) at the IGF2/H19 locus on chromosome 11p15 (SRS type 1), while about 10% of affected children have maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (SRS type 2). A smaller proportion of cases are due to structural aberrations of the short arm of chromosome 11 (SRS type 3). Other less common types of Silver-Russell syndrome have been described with defects on chromosome 8q12.1 (SRS type 4) and 12q14.3 (SRS type 5). Even an X-linked form has been described. Children with SRS type 1 (caused by hypomethylation of the ICR1 on chromosome 11p15) seem to have the most severe phenotype with smaller size at birth and no significant change in height SDS postnatally when compared with children with SRS type 2 (caused by maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7) who have a longer birth length but show a decline in height SDS postnatally. Additionally, children with SRS type 1 (11p15 epimutation) have significantly higher levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 (usually within normal range for age) and these levels increase significantly after GH treatment. This suggests a certain degree of IGF-1 resistance. Children with SRS type 2 (uniparental disomy of chromosome 7) typically have IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels that are low for age. The child in this vignette has IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels in the normal range, making hypomethylation of the ICR1 on chromosome 11p15 (Answer E) more likely than maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (Answer C).",

All the major type 1 diabetes autoantigens are related to the secretory apparatus of the β cell. Assessing zinc tranporter-8 antibodies (Answer A) could be a logical next step in addition to the 3 antibodies tested in the vignette (all undetectable), but this will not lead to the correct diagnosis since the patient has additional clinical clues that should make the learner consider an alternative diagnosis beyond type 1 diabetes. HLA typing (Answer B) is neither cost-effective nor useful in establishing the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and should not be pursued.",

        "answer": "C. Initiate levothyroxine to maintain TSH <0.1 mIU/L, 2 to 3 months after surgery, measure TSH-stimulated thyroglobulin and perform diagnostic whole-body 123I scan",
        "explanation": "The key to answering this question is determining the patient’s risk category and recognizing the importance of postoperative staging in guiding further management. The patient’s risk category is based on the 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) Management Guidelines for Children with Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid Cancer, which primarily address papillary thyroid cancer. The risk is defined as the likelihood of having persistent cervical disease and/or distant metastases after initial total thyroidectomy with or without lymph node dissection by a high-volume surgeon. The degree of risk is determined by the spread of cancer to cervical lymph nodes (N1a in the central neck compartment, or N1b in the lateral neck) or local spread beyond the thyroid (locally invasive T4 tumors), with or without distant metastases. Once the risk category is determined, one can follow the guidelines for recommended management and monitoring. This patient had a central and right lateral neck dissection based on preoperative imaging and was found to have extensive N1b disease. Therefore, she has an ATA pediatric high-risk tumor. While it is true that many pediatric patients with high-risk papillary thyroid cancer require 131I, not all do. Postoperative staging includes both TSH-stimulated thyroglobulin measurement and a 123I whole-body scan, as detailed in the pediatric guidelines. Whole-body scanning helps determine whether there is any cervical uptake outside of the thyroid bed (metastatic lymphadenopathy) or any distant metastases. Whole-body scanning may miss pulmonary micrometastases, which only show up on post-131I scan. When a high-volume thyroid surgeon performs the thyroidectomy, the odds of any significant thyroid remnant are reduced. Documenting a stimulated thyroglobulin value is helpful in patients without cervical or distant metastases on whole-body scanning. A low stimulated thyroglobulin value (<2 ng/mL [<2 μg/L], assuming negative thyroglobulin antibodies) helps identify which patients do not require 131I. Those with a thyroglobulin concentration greater than 10 ng/mL (>10 μg/L) should have 131I ablation, followed by a posttreatment scan. Those with an in-between thyroglobulin value (2-10 ng/mL [2-10 μg/L]) may benefit from 131I ablation, especially if the tumor has aggressive features such as vascular invasion or is a locally invasive (T4) tumor. Patients with distant metastases require 131I radioablation, but it may be delayed if resectable cervical disease remains. Chest CT (Answer A), with its associated radiation, is not recommended for all patients at high risk. Furthermore, it may miss pulmonary micrometastases. While it is recommended to maintain TSH less than 0.1 mIU/L in patients at high risk, as one cannot rely solely on unstimulated thyroglobulin measurement at this stage, a whole-body scan is also necessary (thus, Answer B is incorrect). Holding off on levothyroxine replacement right after surgery and administering 131I once the TSH concentration is greater than 30 mIU/L is incorrect, as it assumes that all patients at high risk should undergo radioablation, without postoperative staging, which is not the case. This approach could fail to identify some resectable disease, which may render the 131I less effective in ablating any distant metastases. Furthermore, thyroid cancer is slow-growing, and there is no rush to ablate 2 to 3 weeks after thyroidectomy when the surgical site may be still healing (thus, Answer D is incorrect). Initiating levothyroxine to maintain TSH between 0.1 and 0.5 mIU/L and performing postoperative 123I wholebody scan (Answer E) is incorrect as well, as it does not include a stimulated thyroglobulin measurement as part of the postoperative staging. While the recommended TSH suppressive level for patients at high risk is less than 0.1 mIU/L, some endocrinologists choose to temporarily keep their patients’ TSH concentration less than 0.5 mIU/L ahead of the TSH-stimulated thyroglobulin measurement and whole-body scan, and thus shorten their levothyroxine withdrawal time. After 131I is given, it is important to maintain the TSH concentration less than 0.1 mIU/L. Initiating levothyroxine to maintain the TSH concentration below 0.1 mIU/L and measuring TSH-stimulated thyroglobulin and performing a diagnostic whole-body 123I scan 2 to 3 months after surgery (Answer C) is the correct management. This approach encompasses the proper postoperative staging and the suppressive TSH level recommended by the pediatric guidelines and does not assume that 131I should be given to all patients at high risk. The use of 131I should be guided by postoperative staging.",

In the last year, he had 4 episodes of abdominal pain, vomiting, hypoglycemia, and ketosis requiring intravenous glucose infusions. His growth chart demonstrates postnatal growth delay with a current height at –3.0 SD. His BMI is at the 3rd percentile. He consumes approximately 2000 calories daily (normal, 1700-1800 calories daily). His parents and 2 younger siblings have a normal phenotype. His mother’s height is 61.4 in (156 cm) (–1.3 SD), and his father’s height is 67.3 in (171 cm) (–0.6 SD). His father is overweight and had delayed puberty. His mother had normal puberty. The patient’s father has a female first cousin who is very short (adult height 55.1 in [140 cm]), but she has never been evaluated for short stature.  The patient has proportional short stature and no dysmorphic features on examination. His current growth velocity is 4 cm/y.

        "answer": "C. Start GH replacement therapy at 0.2 mg/kg per week",
        "explanation": "This patient’s height is more affected than his weight, and he has a normal caloric intake. He has no signs or symptoms of malabsorption. His laboratory test results are concerning for possible GH deficiency. Thus, it is not appropriate to provide reassurance (Answer A) or wait until gastrointestinal evaluation is completed (Answer B). He had normal thyroid function and adrenal function when tested, so it is not necessary to repeat these labs again (Answer E). His clinical picture of normal prenatal growth, poor postnatal growth, episodes of hypoglycemia, proportional short stature without dysmorphic features, and delayed bone age plus his laboratory results (lownormal IGF-1, low stimulated GH concentration, otherwise normal pituitary workup) indicate that he has isolated GH deficiency. Patients with isolated GH deficiency are generally started on GH treatment at a dosage of 0.18 to 0.25 mg/kg per week (to minimize the risk of adverse effects), which is then titrated based on growth response. This dosage is lower than the starting dosage for other indications such as idiopathic short stature, small-for-gestational- age with poor catch-up growth, or conditions such as Turner syndrome or Noonan syndrome. The starting dosage of 0.35 mg/kg per week (Answer D) is too high. There is a family history of short stature on the paternal side (the father’s first cousin). Thus, it is prudent to consider genetic testing to evaluate for genetic causes of GH deficiency, to assess whether this patient is at risk for developing multiple pituitary hormone deficiency in the future, and to understand the need to test other family members. Therefore, the best strategy is to start GH replacement therapy at a dosage of 0.2 mg/kg per week and consider genetic testing (Answer C). Several patients with short stature inherited in an autosomal dominant manner have been shown to have a missense pathogenic variant (p.A204E) resulting in complete loss of constitutive activity of the GH secretagogue receptor. The GH secretagogue receptor is a 7-transmembrane G-protein–coupled receptor that is highly expressed in the pituitary and hypothalamus (also known as the ghrelin receptor, as it binds to and is activated by ghrelin). This patient was reported to have compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the gene encoding the GH secretagogue receptor (GHSR). Patients with GHSR pathogenic variants are known to have delayed puberty as well (as reported in his father). The patient responded well to GH therapy and had delayed pubertal onset at age 15 years.

        "options": "A. MKRN3 gene variant; B. GNAS gene variant; C. Idiopathic; D. Craniopharyngioma; E. Hypothalamic hamartoma.",
        "answer": "E. Hypothalamic hamartoma",
        "explanation": "Precocious puberty, defined as breast development before age 8 years in girls, has been increasing in prevalence since age cutoffs were established in the 1960s. The percentage of girls with precocious puberty is now approximately 10%, with central precocious puberty accounting for 90% to 95% of cases. The prevalence of central nervous system abnormalities is much lower in girls with central precocious puberty than in boys and decreases with age. In one recent meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of intracranial lesions was 25% in girls younger than 6 years (n = 173) and 3% in girls aged 6 to 8 years (n = 514). In this pool of 1853 individuals, the incidence of tumors was 1.6%. Hypothalamic hamartomas are considered to be the most common cause of central precocious puberty among girls with central nervous system lesions. These are rare, congenital, benign lesions located in the ventral hypothalamus that are highly associated with gelastic seizures and treatment-resistant epilepsy. The girl in this vignette has central precocious puberty as indicated by the presence of Tanner stage 3 breast development and pubertal gonadotropins. She has a history suspicious for gelastic seizures, which are primarily manifested by sudden outbursts of laughter or crying for no apparent reason and lasting less than a minute. Given her presentation of central precocious puberty with probable gelastic seizures, she most likely has central precocious puberty due to a hypothalamic hamartoma (Answer E). While idiopathic central precocious puberty is more common than all other causes of central precocious puberty at this age, the presence of gelastic seizures makes idiopathic (Answer C) or genetic causes of central precocious puberty less likely. Many cases of central precocious puberty previously considered idiopathic now have known genetic etiologies, with variants in the MKRN3 gene (Answer A) being the most common. MKRN3 encodes the Makorin ring finger protein 3, a protein that normally functions to inhibit the release of hypothalamic GnRH. Variants in the MKRN3 gene result in loss of GnRH inhibition in childhood, which leads to central precocious puberty. Variants in the GNAS gene (Answer B) causing constitutive activation of the G-protein subunit Gsα result in gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty as part of McCune-Albright syndrome. As the patient in this vignette has central precocious puberty, McCune-Albright syndrome is an unlikely diagnosis. Craniopharyngiomas (Answer D) are also associated with central precocious puberty. As they expand, craniopharyngiomas can disrupt pituitary function and cause central precocious puberty. However, they most commonly affect children between 5 and 14 years of age and are typically associated with findings such as visual field deficits, nausea and vomiting, headaches, growth failure, and diabetes insipidus. Subsequent workup was notable for a 10-mm lesion consistent with a hypothalamic hamartoma found on MRI and electroencephalography findings of occasional bursts (1-2 seconds) of very high-voltage, semirhythmic delta activity consistent with gelastic seizures, which have been well controlled with anticonvulsant medication. While hypothalamic hamartomas are rare (1:200,000 to 1:600,000), gelastic seizures and precocious puberty are common manifestations. Other endocrine manifestations, including GH deficiency and Cushing syndrome, are rarely reported in this setting. Surgery is not usually required; increased appetite and obesity are common long-term postoperative complications in individuals who require surgical resection.",

The patient was diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism at 4 weeks of age after presenting with prolonged jaundice. He was born at home, and no newborn screening was performed.

        "answer": "C. Severity of hypothyroidism at diagnosis",
        "explanation": "Hearing impairment is more common in children with congenital hypothyroidism than in the general population. One population-based study reported the presence of hearing impairment in 9.5% of patients with congenital hypothyroidism. In this study, hearing impairment in patients with congenital hypothyroidism was most often diagnosed between 3 and 19 years of age (median 7 years). Hearing deficits may be detected on neonatal hearing screening (if performed), but not all cases will be detected in this way. Hearing impairment in congenital hypothyroidism is mild to moderate in most cases, and severe in about 10%. For these reasons, long-term management of patients with congenital hypothyroidism should include careful attention to speech and language development, delays in which may indicate underlying hearing deficits. Formal hearing testing should be recommended for any patient in whom hearing impairment is suspected. The severity of congenital hypothyroidism at diagnosis (Answer C) is a risk factor for associated hearing impairment. This may be related to the key role of thyroid hormone in cochlear development in the prenatal period. Patients with ectopic thyroid have a lower risk of hearing impairment than those with thyroid agenesis or a eutopic thyroid gland, perhaps because patients with thyroid ectopy generally have milder hypothyroidism. Postnatal treatment factors, including timing of treatment initiation (Answer A), rate of thyroid function normalization (Answer B), or treatment adequacy during childhood (Answer D), do not appear to be related to the risk of hearing impairment. This risk is also unrelated to sex (Answer E). Sensorineural hearing loss in a patient with congenital hypothyroidism and a eutopic thyroid gland can be observed in Pendred syndrome, a rare recessive disorder caused by inactivating pathogenic variants in the pendrin gene (SLC26A4). Most patients with Pendred syndrome have goiter, which may not be evident until adolescence or adulthood, and are euthyroid or have mild hypothyroidism, unlike the patient in this vignette. However, it is important to recognize that patients with congenital hypothyroidism of any etiology, particularly if severe, are at increased risk for hearing deficits and require close monitoring and prompt evaluation for hearing concerns.",

        "answer": "E. TSH-producing adenoma",
        "explanation": "This girl presents with signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, goiter, elevated free T4 and total T3 levels, and an inappropriately elevated TSH level. When approaching the evaluation of inappropriate TSH secretion and elevated thyroid hormone levels, it is important to rule out genetic causes and interference from medications such as estrogen. Once medication or other laboratory interference has been ruled out, measurement of thyroid function in first-degree relatives is important. This girl is taking an oral contraceptive pill, which most likely contains estrogen. While total T4 levels may be elevated due to an increase in thyroxine-binding globulin seen with estrogen, the free T4 level would be normal, as would the TSH level. In addition, this patient appears clinically hyperthyroid. Therefore, medication interference causing abnormal laboratory findings (Answer A) is incorrect. Graves disease (Answer D) is a common cause of hyperthyroidism and, in fact, this patient’s mother had Graves disease. Measurement of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins and TSH-binding inhibitory immunoglobulins can be helpful. However, in this setting, the TSH level is expected to be suppressed, so Graves disease is incorrect. The syndrome of familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia (Answer C) presents with elevated total and normal or elevated free T4 serum values in clinically euthyroid patients with normal TSH levels (euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia). This is an inherited abnormality (autosomal dominant) characterized by the presence of a variant serum albumin that has preferential affinity for T4. The hyperthyroxinemia can be confused with hyperthyroidism. This girl is clinically hyperthyroid, has a goiter, and has elevated TSH. Therefore, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia is incorrect. Both TSH-secreting adenomas (Answer E) and resistance to thyroid hormone β (Answer B) have elevated thyroid hormones in common and can present with goiter, but the peripheral response to the hyperthyroxinemia is different. Resistance to thyroid hormone β is due to abnormalities in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (TRHB) and is generally inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It can be difficult to distinguish between these 2 entities, highlighting the importance of assessing thyroid function in first-degree relatives. TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas are a very rare cause of hyperthyroidism with inappropriate TSH elevations and are even rarer in the pediatric population. In most cases, these adenomas are located in the pituitary, but a few instances of ectopic TSH production have been reported in the suprasellar region and nasopharynx. TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas are the rarest of the pituitary adenomas and can be either microadenomas or macroadenomas and may be found incidentally on imaging for other causes. In patients with TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas, cosecretion of GH and prolactin is common. Interestingly, although no values are given for GH or prolactin levels in this vignette, the patient is much taller than her midparental height, suggesting the possibility of excess GH secretion. Measurement of other pituitary function is essential. MRI would be particularly important to perform in this individual. A thyrotropin-releasing hormone test may be helpful to distinguish between a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma and resistance to thyroid hormones. TSH rises appropriately after thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation in patients with resistance to thyroid hormone but not in most patients with TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas. Measurement of serum α-subunit may also be a helpful diagnostic tool and is elevated in approximately 30% of individuals with TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas.",

She had a prior low-trauma tibial fracture at 2 years of age. The patient ambulates with the assistance of lower-extremity braces and a wheelchair for longer distances. She has a regular diet and consumes milk at breakfast and cheese at lunch. She also has a history of epilepsy that is well controlled with levetiracetam (she has been seizure-free for the last 2 years). DXA of her total body less head shows a height-adjusted Z-score of –2.1. Metabolic bone workup reveals normal calcium, phosphate, and magnesium; mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase for age; and a 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of 15.8 ng/mL (39.4 nmol/L).",

        "answer": "B. Start supplemental vitamin D and calcium",
        "explanation": "The child in this vignette fulfills criteria for pediatric osteoporosis in that she has a bone mineral density less than –2.0 and has sustained 2 low-trauma fractures by age 10 years. Potential risk factors for impaired bone health include altered mechanical stimulation due to inadequate weight-bearing activity and nutrient deficiency. The effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone density in children is conflicting, but the best evidence suggests a small beneficial effect in prepubertal girls who receive vitamin D supplementation in addition to adequate calcium intake (Answer B). Review of this child’s dietary intake revealed that she is getting only 2 servings of calcium each day, which is unlikely to provide the recommended daily allotment of 1300 mg of calcium. Therefore, supplementing vitamin D alone (Answer A) would not correct the calcium deficiency. While vitamin D and calcium supplementation as primary prevention for falls and fractures is not supported by evidence (US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement), this strategy is still recommended for patients with vitamin D deficiency and those with an increased risk for osteoporosis. Of the options available, starting supplemental vitamin D and calcium is the best treatment choice for this child. Anticonvulsant medications have historically been associated with an increased risk for impaired bone mineral density and fractures; however, the evidence for this is primarily with older anticonvulsant medications such as phenytoin and valproic acid through mechanisms of impaired vitamin D metabolism. Newer anticonvulsant medications such as levetiracetam may be associated with low vitamin D, but they have not been shown to have negative effects on bone density. In addition, because seizures increase the potential for falls and trauma-related fractures, stopping this medication could result in increased fracture risk (Answer E). The patient is of pubertal age, and estrogen exposure is clearly beneficial for improving bone density. However, the incidence of fractures increases around the time of the pubertal growth spurt; thus, induction of puberty (Answer D) may increase her risk for subsequent fractures (albeit temporarily). In addition, it is normal for girls to be prepubertal at this age, so there is no indication to commence puberty even with a low bone density. Bisphosphonate therapy (Answer C) has been shown to improve bone mineral density in secondary osteoporosis; however, the reduction in fracture risk is unknown. While this patient meets criteria for pediatric osteoporosis, the benefit in fracture risk reduction is likely to be minimal given that her bone mineral density Z-score is just below the normal range. In addition, bisphosphonate therapy is not recommended in the setting of low vitamin D due to the increased risk for severe hypocalcemia.",

        "options": "A. Poor regimen adherence; B. Puberty; C. Gastritis; D. Obesity; E. Drug interaction.",
        "answer": "B. Puberty",
        "explanation": "This child was found to have increased cortisol clearance, most likely due to the onset of puberty (Answer B). Alterations in cortisol dynamics may occur in puberty for many reasons, including changes in 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity (altering cortisol/cortisone conversion), estradiol-related increase in cortisol-binding globulin (altering free cortisol), and GH secretion leading to increased glomerular filtration. Collectively, this leads to reduced circulating cortisol. The glucocorticoid of choice for the treatment of children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is hydrocortisone given orally 3 times daily. In the case of increased cortisol clearance in puberty, an increase in dosing frequency may be necessary rather than increasing the dosage. A recent publication reported improved cortisol concentrations on a regimen of 4 daily doses. Obesity (Answer D) increases cortisol clearance due to insulin insensitivity. In this case, the patient had been growing along the same percentiles for weight and height. Other factors, including fatty liver disease (increased cortisol clearance), hepatic metabolism (particularly the cytochrome P450 system), 11β‐hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme activity, 5α‐reductase system activity, thyroid hormone levels, cortisol‐binding globulin concentration, and numerous medications can all alter cortisol metabolism. All of these factors should be considered when assessing a patient with suboptimally controlled CAH. Gastritis (Answer C) could lead to poor absorption; however, the child in this vignette was given hydrocortisone intravenously, which would bypass any gut issues. Drugs interactions (Answer E) should always be considered. Erythromycin is a known inhibitor of CYP3A4 enzyme activity (involved in the elimination of glucocorticoids). Inhibition of CYP3A4 leads to increased glucocorticoid availability. Vitamin D supplementation has no effect on cortisol metabolism. In contrast, CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbitone, lead to increased clearance and reduced efficacy of coadministered glucocorticoids and increased risk of adrenal crisis. Poor regimen adherence (Answer A) is often used to explain suboptimal control of CAH during puberty. However, physiologic changes in puberty that can alter cortisol clearance should always be considered before concluding that poor regimen adherence is the cause.",

Calcitonin and calcium levels are normal. There is no family history of thyroid cancer. Ultrasonography reveals a 2.8-cm, right-sided, hypoechoic, solid nodule with microcalcifications and a smaller 1.2-cm nodule on the left lower pole of the thyroid. Ultrasonography also identifies a number of right-sided lymph nodes that are suspicious for malignancy. Findings from FNA biopsy of both nodules are suspicious for malignancy. He undergoes total thyroidectomy, with bilateral central neck dissection and right lateral neck dissection. Histopathologic examination reveals classic papillary thyroid cancer involving both lobes, with spread to the central and lateral neck compartments (T2N1bMx).",
        "question": "Which of the following is the most likely pathogenic genetic alteration expected in this patient?",
        "options": "A. RET proto-oncogene pathogenic variant; B. RET/PTC fusion; C. PAX8/PPARG fusion; D. NTRK3/ETV6 fusion; E. BRAF V600E pathogenic variant.",
        "answer": "E. BRAF V600E pathogenic variant",
        "explanation": "Thyroid cancer is the most prevalent endocrine malignancy and is the third most frequent solid tumor in pediatric patients. The most common histologic type is papillary thyroid carcinoma, accounting for about two-thirds of nonmedullary thyroid cancer. As noted in the vignette, the histopathologic examination revealed classic papillary thyroid carcinoma. In both adult and pediatric patients, the single most common genetic abnormality found in classic papillary thyroid cancer is the BRAF V600E pathogenic variant (Answer E), accounting for about 30% to 40% of cases. However, the reality is a bit more complex. Although BRAF V600E is the most common pathogenic variant in pediatric patients with classic papillary thyroid cancer, it is observed more often in older adolescents (typically >15 years). RET/PTC fusions seem to occur in younger patients and have been associated equally or more frequently with other types of papillary thyroid cancer in the pediatric population, including the diffuse variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. RET/PTC fusions (Answer B) (most common RET/PTC1) and NTRK fusions (Answer D) (most common NTRK3/ETV6), as well as BRAF pathogenic variants (almost exclusively BRAF V600E) all lead to papillary thyroid cancer via activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. RET/PTC and NTRK fusions are much more common in pediatric patients with papillary thyroid cancer than in adults, and gene fusions combined are more common in pediatric patients than BRAF V600E mutation alone. However, each fusion group on its own is usually not the most common genetic alteration. Furthermore, the BRAF V600E pathogenic variant has recently been documented to be the most common genetic alteration in classic papillary thyroid carcinoma in children and adolescents. The PAX8/PPARG fusion (Answer C) is observed in follicular variants of papillary thyroid cancer, not in classic papillary thyroid cancer. Pathogenic variants in the RET proto-oncogene (Answer A) cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. RET M918T is the pathogenic variant that accounts for most multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B cases, while a number of other RET variants account for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, with good correlation between genotype and aggressiveness of the medullary thyroid cancer. However, the patient in this vignette does not have medullary thyroid cancer. Although medullary thyroid cancer nodules can have microcalcifications noted on ultrasonography, when medullary thyroid cancer has spread and is associated with cervical lymph node metastases, the calcitonin concentration is elevated. This patient’s calcitonin level was normal. As this patient does not have medullary thyroid cancer, a pathogenic variant in the RET gene is incorrect. Another type of differentiated thyroid cancer is follicular thyroid cancer. Patients with follicular thyroid cancer do not commonly present with cervical lymph node metastases. Cervical lymph node metastases are common in papillary thyroid cancer (more so in pediatric patients), as are psammoma bodies on histopathologic examination and microcalcifications on ultrasonography. RAS variants have been found in follicular thyroid cancer and follicular variants of papillary thyroid cancer.",

She has no developmental delay. In addition to short stature in her father and 2 paternal first cousins, her family history is notable for multiple lumbar disk herniations and osteoarthritis of the knees in the third decade of life. On physical examination, she is overweight and has brachydactyly and midface hypoplasia. She has no signs of puberty. Her sitting height to standing height ratio is 0.54, and her arm span is 1 cm more than her height. Her bone age is interpreted to be 6 years.",
        "question": "Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s short stature?",
        "options": "A. Familial short stature; B. GNAS pathogenic variant; C. 45,X karyotype; D. FGFR3 pathogenic variant; E. ACAN pathogenic variant.",
        "answer": "E. ACAN pathogenic variant",
        "explanation": "This patient has proportional short stature as evidenced by her normal sitting height to standing height ratio and normal difference between arm span and height. Thus, she does not have features typical of an FGFR3 pathogenic variant (Answer D), which results in achondroplasia. Classic features of achondroplasia include macrocephaly, short limbs (rhizomelic dwarfism), and significant short stature. Although FGFR3 pathogenic variants are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, most affected patients (about 80%) do not have a family history of achondroplasia but rather have a de novo variant. Turner syndrome (45,X karyotype) (Answer C) is one of the common causes of short stature in girls. However, this patient does not have features suggestive of Turner syndrome such as a webbed neck, lymphedema, or a congenital heart defect. Also, the history of short stature in her father and paternal cousins suggests the likely presence of an inherited cause of short stature other than Turner syndrome. Pathogenic variants in the GNAS gene (Answer B) result in a rare condition known as Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. Albright hereditary osteodystrophy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Patients with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy may have a wide range of signs and symptoms, including short stature, obesity, brachydactyly, round face, and subcutaneous ossifications. In addition, patients who inherit the disorder from their mother also have evidence of resistance to 1 or more hormones, especially PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a). However, patients who inherit the disorder from their father have the Albright hereditary osteodystrophy phenotype, but do not have any hormone resistance (pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism). This patient does not have the classic phenotype of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy such as obesity, round face, or subcutaneous ossifications. Also, there is no evidence of hormone resistance. Familial short stature (Answer A) is a nonpathologic variant of growth and thus it cannot be considered the cause of short stature in a child with advanced bone age and significant family history of early-onset joint disease. It is important to note that family members with short stature, in this case the patient’s father, may have undiagnosed pathologic conditions leading to poor growth. Her family history of short stature and early-onset lumbar disk herniation and osteoarthritis of the knees is highly indicative of an ACAN pathogenic variant (Answer E), which affects aggrecan—a major proteoglycan component of the extracellular matrix in the growth plate and articular cartilage. Patients with ACAN pathogenic variants may have mild to moderate dysmorphic features, including macrocephaly, brachydactyly, flat nasal bridge, and midface hypoplasia. Many children, but not all, with ACAN pathogenic variants have advanced bone age (as seen in this case), even in prepubertal years, and have a shortened pubertal growth spurt resulting in proportional short stature.",

        "answer": "E. Orlistat",
        "explanation": "A number of weight-loss medications have been approved by the US FDA. Such medications can be considered for individuals with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater or those with a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or greater who have at least 1 obesity-related comorbidity (eg, dyslipidemia). Most weight-loss medications are only approved for patients who are 16 years old or older. Intensive lifestyle modifications that are age-appropriate and family-based are still first-line therapy. However, pharmacotherapy could be considered for a patient with obesity who has not lost weight despite participation in a formal lifestyle modification program, or in an effort to decrease comorbidities. Pharmacotherapy should only be prescribed by clinicians who have experience using such therapies and are familiar with potential adverse risks. Off-label use of obesity medications in adolescents younger than 16 years is not recommended because of lack of FDA approval, limited efficacy and safety data in children and adolescents, and risks for potential adverse effects. Orlistat (Answer E) is the only FDA-approved medication for obesity treatment of adolescents who are between the ages of 12 to 16 years. Orlistat can reduce fat absorption by up to 30% through inhibition of gastrointestinal lipases, and it reduces BMI by 0.7 to 1.7 kg/m2. However, it has significant gastrointestinal adverse effects, including fatty stools, fecal incontinence, and increased defecation, which lead to its discontinuation in many patients. A multivitamin should be recommended for all patients taking this medication since it can impede the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Phentermine (Answer A) is only approved for short-term weight loss in adults. Some of its potential adverse effects include paresthesias, dizziness, insomnia, and constipation. Octreotide (Answer B) may have a potential role in the treatment of hypothalamic obesity, but it is not an FDA-approved obesity medication. Metformin (Answer C) is not FDA-approved as an obesity medication and its use results in limited reductions in BMI. It is approved for patients 10 years or older for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide (Answer D) is a GLP-1 analogue, which is approved for long-term weight loss in adults. It is FDA-approved for the treatment of pediatric patients 10 years or older with type 2 diabetes, but not for weight loss.

        "options": "A. Decreased energy consumption; B. Increased leptin resistance; C. Decreased fatty liver; D. Increased energy expenditure; E. Reduced insulin secretion.",
        "answer": "A. Decreased energy consumption",
        "explanation": "Oxytocin is a nonapeptide hormone synthesized by the magnocellular neurons in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus. A single axon from each magnocellular neuron projects to the posterior pituitary gland where oxytocin is released. Oxytocin is well known to be involved in the regulation of labor, where it stimulates ripening of the cervix and facilitates uterine contraction and clotting post partum. It also stimulates the let-down reflex in lactation. More recently, knowledge of the role of oxytocin in regulation of other physiologic processes has been expanding. Oxytocin has been implicated in psychological and social behaviors such as cognitive empathy, trust, attachment, and anxiolysis. Knockout mice deficient in oxytocin or the oxytocin receptor are obese and have glucose intolerance. Oxytocin administration in these animals reduces food intake (decreases energy consumption [Answer A]), increases energy expenditure [Answer D], and improves glucose homeostasis. However, the increase in energy expenditure seen with oxytocin administration in animals has not been confirmed in humans. Obese animals are more sensitive than lean animals to the effects of oxytocin administration. In humans, obesity increases plasma leptin levels and promotes leptin resistance. Conversely, obesity decreases plasma oxytocin levels and increases oxytocin receptor expression in adipose tissue and the central nervous system. Exogenous administration of oxytocin decreases food intake and fat mass in animals and humans with severe obesity. Since oxytocin decreases food intake and fat mass in leptin-resistant animal models, it may improve (decrease) leptin resistance (thus, Answer B is incorrect). In addition, oxytocin promotes pancreatic β-cell response to glucose in obese states and improves insulin secretion (thus, Answer E is incorrect). While it may improve fatty liver (Answer C), this would not be the most likely mechanism for weight loss. In a case report of an 8-year-old boy with craniopharyngioma and evidence of damage to the region of the paraventricular nuclei and supraoptic nuclei, treatment with intranasal oxytocin resulted in a decrease in hunger and hyperphagia. However, the patient continued to have impulsive hedonic food-seeking behaviors. It was postulated that these continued behaviors may have been due to damage to other neuronal brain circuitry involved in the brain reward system. The precise role of oxytocin in the regulation of food intake continues to evolve. Studies evaluating the role of intranasal oxytocin as a therapy for obesity, including in Prader-Willi syndrome, are ongoing.",

Having not achieved remission of Graves disease, she wishes to pursue definitive therapy for hyperthyroidism. She reports no symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.

        "answer": "D. FNA of the thyroid nodule",
        "explanation": "This adolescent patient with Graves disease has not achieved remission of hyperthyroidism and has evidence of active disease (positive thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin) after more than 2 years of treatment with antithyroid medication. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider all options for ongoing therapy, including continuing antithyroid medication or pursuing definitive therapy with radioactive iodine (131I) or thyroidectomy. Management should be guided by an informed discussion with the patient of the risks and benefits of each approach. This older adolescent desires definitive therapy and has no contraindication to either radioactive iodine (Answer B) or thyroidectomy (Answer E), so proceeding with either approach would have been reasonable, depending on patient preference, in the absence of a thyroid nodule. In this case, however, an abnormality on thyroid examination led to discovery of a thyroid nodule. Thyroid enlargement in patients with Graves disease is usually symmetric: significant thyroid asymmetry or palpation of a discrete nodule should prompt further evaluation with thyroid ultrasonography. Thyroid scintigraphy (Answer C) is recommended for the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules in patients with a low TSH concentration to identify an autonomous nodule. Scintigraphy would not be useful in this patient with a normal TSH value; even if methimazole were withdrawn to achieve a low TSH level, scintigraphy generally is not effective for identifying autonomous nodules in patients with active Graves disease due to the background of diffuse thyroid gland autonomy. The prevalence of thyroid cancer in children with Graves disease may be as high as 1.8%, and a diagnosis of thyroid cancer would affect management decisions about definitive therapy. Therefore, thyroid nodules with concerning features should be evaluated by ultrasound-guided FNA (Answer D) before any decision about definitive therapy for Graves disease. Thyroid ultrasonography should also include evaluation of cervical lymph nodes for potential evidence of metastatic thyroid carcinoma that may alter management. The sonographic features of this thyroid nodule (solid, hypoechoic, calcifications) are concerning for malignancy; therefore, waiting to reevaluate the nodule in 3 months (Answer A) is not appropriate.",

This includes knowledge of criteria for puberty-blocking and gender-affirming hormone treatment in adolescents. - Decisions regarding the social transition of prepubertal youths with gender dysphoria/gender incongruence should be made with the assistance of a mental health professional or another experienced professional. - Adolescents who meet diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria/gender incongruence, fulfill criteria for treatment, and are requesting treatment should initially undergo treatment to suppress pubertal development. - Clinicians should begin pubertal hormone suppression after signs of puberty develop. Where indicated, GnRH analogues should be used to suppress pubertal hormones. -  Initiation of sex hormone treatment (partly irreversible) is recommended after a multidisciplinary team of medical and mental health providers has confirmed the persistence of gender dysphoria/gender incongruence and sufficient mental capacity exists to give informed consent, which most adolescents have by age 16 years. The patient in this vignette has been followed by a qualified mental health professional, has met criteria for gender dysphoria, is in puberty, and has requested treatment to suppress male development. According to the guidelines, she meets criteria to start treatment with a GnRH analogue (Answer B) to prevent further pubertal changes. Early puberty is an ideal time to start puberty blockers in children with gender dysphoria to prevent or delay the development of undesired secondary sexual characteristics. Pubertal suppression is reversible and enables full pubertal development in the natal gender after cessation of treatment if desired. For those who ultimately choose to proceed with irreversible treatments, early suppression of puberty can help the individual avoid the need for future surgeries and is associated with better physical outcomes. It has also been shown that early access to pubertal suppression is linked to better psychological outcomes and lower suicide risk for transgender patients. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Answer C) can be used as an alternative to GnRH analogues to suppress testosterone production. However, this medication is not as effective as GnRH analogues at lowering endogenous androgen production and is associated with adverse effects, including fatigue, weight gain, and increased risk of blood clots. Starting low-dosage estradiol (Answer A) is not indicated at this age. Guidelines from the Endocrine Society and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health recommend against gender-affirming hormone treatment until approximately 16 years of age. Aside from lack of data studying the effects of this treatment in a younger age group, guidelines require that before starting gender-affirming hormone treatment, an individual must have sufficient mental capacity and maturity to understand the consequences of partly irreversible treatment (which include potential loss of fertility). Treatment to block pubertal progression is considered reversible and not likely to affect future fertility. Current guidelines do not explicitly recommend counseling on fertility (Answer D) until an individual is ready to consider gender-affirming hormone treatment. This patient’s gender dysphoria may be transient. However, allowing puberty to progress over time (Answer E) may lead to detrimental outcomes for the patient in terms of masculinization, which can increase complexity of gender-affirming treatment and confer a greater risk of psychological harm.",
